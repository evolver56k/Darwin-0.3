 * This file gives definitions supplementing <nlist.h> for permanent symbol
 * table entries of Mach-O files.  Modified from the BSD definitions.  The
 * modifications from the original definitions were changing what the values of
 * what was the n_other field (an unused field) which is now the n_sect field.
 * These modifications are required to support symbols in an arbitrary number of
 * sections not just the three sections (text, data and bss) in a BSD file.
 * The values of the defined constants have NOT been changed.
 *
 * These must have one of the N_STAB bits on.  The n_value fields are subject
 * to relocation according to the value of their n_sect field.  So for types
 * that refer to things in sections the n_sect field must be filled in with the
 * proper section ordinal.  For types that are not to have their n_value field 
 * relocatated the n_sect field must be NO_SECT.
