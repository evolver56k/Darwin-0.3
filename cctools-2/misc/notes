To Do:
- Have cmpdylib check Objc info Tracker bug #78124.
- Fix a bug in strip on line 1105 where it uses missing_reloc_symbols when it
  could have been set otherwise and does not print the next line.
- Maybe add fat support for segedit(1)

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-292 release):
- Added some braces to get rid of the warning message from the egcs compiler
  "warning: suggest explicit braces to avoid ambiguous `else'".  This was done
  to cmpdylib.c .
- Changed the return type of main() in redo_prebinding.c, pagestuff.c,
  dylib_pcsampler.c, cmpdylib.c, kern_tool.c, segedit.c, strip.c, indr.c,
  checksyms.c, libtool.c, nm.c, strings.c, size.c and lipo.c from void to int to
  remove a warning from the egcs compiler.  Also changed the exit() calls at the
  end to return()'s.

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-290 release):
- Fixed a bug in nmedit in the code that was added to support the -p flag.

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-289 release):
- Added the -p flag to nmedit to change symbols into private externs rather
  than static.

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-288 release):
- Changed nmedit(l) to change the indirect symbol table entries for global
  symbols it makes static.  The indirect symbols are changed to
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL or INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS.  This problem showed up in
  using nmedit for the work around with the egcs compiler and C++ RTTI common
  data in a dynamic shared library.
- Added passing -whyload through libtool to ld.
- Changed some type and casts to make strip.c compile with the MetroWerks
  compiler.
- Changed the message printed when the environment variable RC_TRACE_ARCHIVES
  is set from: "RC_TRACE_ARCHIVES archive_name" to: "[Logging for Build &
  Integration] Used static archive: archive_name".  Radar bug #2310273.

Changes for the the 5.3 release (the cctools-285 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool(1) that was not using NEXT_ROOT when set to expand
  -l flags.
- Added printing a line like "RC_TRACE_ARCHIVES archive_name", where
  archive_name is a archive being put into the output of libtool(1) -static.
  This is done when the environment variable RC_TRACE_ARCHIVES is set.
  Radar bug #2303376.
- Removed the #ifdef NeXT from atom.c .
- Fixed a bug in ranlib (aka libtool) where when dealing with multiple symbols
  defined in the same members, it trys to only print each table of contents
  entry once by marking the symbol by changing the sign on the ran_off field.
  There were two missing casts on two comparisons because the ran_off is
  unsigned.
- Fixed a bug in strip in strip_symtab() where when it was walking the reference
  table looking for symbols not yet listed as saved it would added them to the
  changes[] array without testing to see it it already added them to the
  changes[] array.  This happens because a symbol may be referenced by more the
  one module in dynamic shared library.  This showed up when the CoreGraphics
  framework was stripped with the -s option and undefined symbols were not
  expicitedly listed.  This caused the code in strip to allocate more new
  undefined symbols maps than it filled it.  The extra maps were garbage and
  caused the module table in the CoreGraphics to be updated wrong which caused
  the static linker to generate the malformed object error:
	ilocalsym field plus nlocalsym field of module table entry 1 past the
	end of the symbol table

Changes for the 5.3 release, MacOS X bring up (the cctools-282 release):
- Added libtool to the Metrowerks source target.
- Changed host_self() and task_self() to mach_host_self() and mach_task_self()
  for MacOS X.  Also included "stuff/openstep_mach.h" for macros to allow it
  to still build on Openstep.  Also changed ifdef's __SLICK__ to __OPENSTEP__.
- Ifdef'ed __MACH30__ make.defs for mach_port_t vs mach_port.  Also ifdef'ed out
  netname_look_up() call and #include <servers/netname.h> for __MACH30__ in
  libtool.c (these are not yet in the SDK).
- Changed the Makefile to allow for RC_OS=macos for MacOS X builds.
- Added a few casts in places to get it to compile with the MetroWerks compiler
  without -relax_pointers.
- Changed the Makefile to nolonger compile checksyms with -static.  When linking
  with -static the MetroWerks compiler uses -framework System which is not
  leagal with ld(1) and -static.
- Changed arch_flag_processed = FALSE; to arch_flag_processed = NULL; in
  translate_input() in indr.c so it would compile with the MetroWerks compiler.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-281 release):
- Changed redo_prebinding to exit with a error code of 3 if the dependent libraries are
  out of date.  Radar bug #2259447.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-280 release):
- Changed libtool to pass the -F and -L flags to objcunique.  Radar bug #2257931.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-276 release):
- The fix in cctools-275 was using the variable "changes" after it was free'ed.
  Move the free() past the last use.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-275 release):
- Made a fix to strip when stripping a dynamic shared library.  If a symbol is
  to be stripped and it was defined in a module and also referenced in another
  module, it was correctly changed to an undefined symbol but incorrecly left
  in the table of contents. Radar bug #2239280.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-274 release):
- Added the -R option to nmedit to provide a list of symbols to turn into 
  static symbols.  If -R is specified and no -s is specified all symbols except
  those in the -R file are "saved" and not turned into static symbols.
  Radar bug #2235926.
- Added the -R option to strip to provide a list of symbols to strip.  Also
  changed the list of symbols to allow comment lines starting with '#' and to
  trim leading and trailing blanks.  Radar bug #2235926.
- Removed uses of CPU_SUBTYPE_586SX in lipo.c and added support for the new
  intel subtypes. Radar bug #2231830.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-271 release):
- Fixed it so libtool -static would not warn about -L and -l flags as these
  are valid flags with -static.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-269 release):
- Backed off checking libtool -dynamic and -static flags as hard errors to
  allow builds to work.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-267 release):
- The -b flag for checksyms(l) is now the default to check for prebinding and
  read_only_relocs.  Radar bug #2227469.
- Fixed a bug in nm(1) with -o that did not print a ':' after the module name
  and before the symbol name.  Radar bug #2227852.
- Fixed a bug in libtool that incorrectly put -framework flags in ld flags and
  not treat it like a file.  This caused -l and -framework to get out of order.
  Radar bug #2227863.
- Added the core program to test dyld debug intefaces from a core file.  This
  program is not built as part of the install target.  It requires a
  libdyld/debug.c compiled with -DCORE.
- Added code to checksyms to allow blank lines in the dylib table.  Radar bug
  #2227872.
- Added all the suport needed for the 4.4BSD extended format #1 to nm, size,
  strip, indr, inout, redo_prebinding, checksyms and lipo.  Radar bug #1670513.
- Added the -L and -T flags to libtools and ranlib to support or truncate long
  archive names.  Added all the suport needed for the 4.4BSD extended format #1
  for long names.  The default is now -L (use long names).  Radar bug #1670513.
- Make libtool -static treat flags for -dynamic as errors.  Also cleaned up
  and corrected other flag checking.  Radar bug #2227885.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-261 release):
- Updated lipo's printing of supported POWERPC subtypes. Radar bug #2213821.
- Fixed a bug in link_library_module() in redo_prebinding.c that did not check
  if the symbol found that might be multiply defined was in a module that was
  not in the UNLINKED state before saying it was multiply defined.
  Radar bug #2213249.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-260 release):
- Added -c to all the install commands in the Makefile.
- Added /Local/Library/Frameworks as a conventional path for frameworks.
- Changed "it's" to "its" in checksyms messages.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-258 release):
- Changed checksyms to know about /usr/lib/java again.  There are two sets of
  java dylibs and this path should have not been removed.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-257 release):
- Changed checksyms to reflect the new Java paths.  Previously was /usr/lib/java
  now is /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Libraries .

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-256 release):
- Added /usr/lib/java as a conventional path for libraries in checksyms.
  Radar bug #2005914.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-253 release):
- Made checksyms check prebinding, read-only relocs and objcunique.  Currently
  enabled only when -b is specified.
- Fixed a bug in checksyms that was not correctly checking for N_FUN stabs.
- Changed the Makefile to only create the needed dst directories.
- Changed checksyms to match the new directory layout for Preimer.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-249 release):
- Added the ppc relocation to redo_prebinding.
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding in update_load_commands() when an executable
  had LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB commands for dylibs that it did not have LC_LOAD_DYLIB
  commands (this was run into because of a bug in ld with $NEXT_ROOT set).  The
  fix is to toss all LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB except the ones that have matching
  LC_LOAD_DYLIB commands.
- Changed redo_prebinding and libtool to look for objcunique in /usr/bin rather
  in /bin.
- Fixed a bug where nm -n on Rhapsody did not sort correctly.  The bug was in
  the compare function that was returning 1 or 0 for less and greater when it
  should have been 1 or -1.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-247 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool.c in check_sort_ranlibs() where the unsigned value
  on lin 1952 was being checked for < 0.  A cast to int was added.
- Added MKDIRS if code to the Makefile to build native on Rhapsody.
- Changed the Makefile to use gnutar instead of tar because it works on Rhapsody
  where tar does not.
- Changed the Makefile to install non-local binaries in /usr/bin for RC_OS
  teflon and in /bin for RC_OS nextstep (Radar 1673496).
- Changed the code ifdef __TEFLON__ to ifndef __SLICK__ (where __TEFLON__ will
  nolonger be defined for Rhapsody builds) so the default builds will be native
  Rhapsody builds.  The changes were to file.c, libtool.c, lipo.c and segedit.c.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-245 release):
- Fixed symbolic links from /usr/bin/strip   to ../../bin/strip
		       from /usr/bin/strings to ../../bin/strings
		       from /usr/bin/size    to ../../bin/size
		       from /usr/bin/nm      to ../../bin/nm
  (Radar 1672088).

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-243 release):
- Added symbolic links from /usr/bin/strip   to $(DSTROOT)/bin/strip
		       from /usr/bin/strings to $(DSTROOT)/bin/strings
		       from /usr/bin/size    to $(DSTROOT)/bin/size
		       from /usr/bin/nm      to $(DSTROOT)/bin/nm
  (Radar 1672088).

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-240 release):
- Changed so that atom only gets installed for OS=nextstep because it used the
  encumbered <gnu/a.out.h>.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-235 release):
- Added an ifdef(ppc) in four places to atom.c to remove some warnings.
- Replace the comments with the OpenBSD comments in nm.c, size.c and strings.c.
- Removed building ar and file when $(RC_OS) is "teflon".  These commands will
  are in there own directories one level up based on the OpenBSD versions.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-224 release):
- Changed including <ranlib.h> to <mach-o/ranlib.h> which uses unsigned long
  instead of off_t (64 bits on Teflon).

Changes for the 5.0 release (cctools-216 release):
- Changed building checksyms to link staticly.  Still does not build in Teflon
  as it needs -lc_static which is currently missing.

Changes for the 5.0 release (cctools-215 release):
- Made a hack in the Makefile to not build checksyms for teflon because it needs
  -lsys because RC wants it built to run on 3.3 machines.

Changes for the 4.2 and 5.0 releases (cctools-213 and cctools-209.4  release):
- Added ignoring -pg to libtool.

Changes for the 5.0 release (cctools-210 release):
- Changed m98k to ppc.

Changes for the 4.2 and 4.1 patch releases (cctools-207 release):
- Added -noall_load and -all_load to libtool.  The compiler driver with the
  option -dynamiclib will call libtool with the -noall_load option by default.
  This is to avoid pulling all of libcc_dynamic.a in which can't be done in
  all cases as it could produce a undefined reference to __DTOR_LIST__.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-202 release):
- Changed libtool to ignore -g[gdb,codeview,stab][number] flags (bug #67597).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-199 release):
- Fixed a problem in redo_prebinding(1) with setting the file's owner and group
  introduced in cctools-196 (bug #65646).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-197 release):
- Added -image_base flag to libtool as synonym for -seg1addr (bug #65273).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-196 release):
- Fixed a problem in redo_prebinding(1) which was not setting the file's owner
  and group (bug #65137).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-192 release):
- Changed redo_prebinding(1) to only run /bin/objcunique when it redoes the
  prebinding.  This was causing /bin/objcunique to fail when run on non-Mach-O
  files in checking modes (bug #63509).
- Changed redo_prebinding(1) to call chmod(2) to set back the original modes so
  setuid and setgid bits get set (bug #63448).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-188 release):
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding where it did not correctly swap the fat files
  it created.  The call to swap_arch_for_output() was done only once and not
  once per architecture in the fat file (bug #62267).
- Fixed a bug in lipo -extract where it would not extract anything except the
  first architecture in the fat file (bug #62145).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-187 release):
- Added a check to checksyms to make sure dynamic libraries have some execute
  bits set (bug #61511).
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding in the function update_load_commands() when
  the load commands had to be rewritten the pointers to the load commands for
  the symtab and dysymtab commands needed to be reset (bug #61735).
- Fixed the spelling of "compatibility" (was "compaiblity") in cmpdylib error
  message (bug #61697).
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding in the function build_new_symbol_table() where
	    arch_nmodtab * sizeof(struct dylib_module *) +
  should have been:
	    arch_nmodtab * sizeof(struct dylib_module) +
  That is the size of the struct not the size of a pointer (bug #61735).
- Changed calling /bin/objcunique to always pass -prebind in redo_prebinding
  and libtool (bug #61735).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-186 release):
- Added passing "-r root_dir" to /bin/objcunique in redo_prebinding.
- Removed the built in table to checksyms and use ~rc/Data/DylibTable by default
  (bug #61427).
- Fixed a bug in nm(1) with the undocumented value difference option (-v) which
  has to be used with -n and -s.  The problem was the test for no selected
  symbols needed to be moved to the outer if statement (bug #61341).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-185 release):
- Added running /bin/objcunique if -prebind or LD_PREBIND is set in libtool
  (bug #61230).
- Fixed a bug in checksyms as it parsed out "/usr/lib" before
  "/usr/lib/NextPrinter" so it thought the name of the libFaxD library was 
  "NextPrinter/libFaxD" not "libFaxD" as it should have been (bug #61231).
- Added table entries to checksyms for (bug #61231):
    { 0x1f000000, "InterfaceBuilder" },
    { 0x20000000, "AppTest" },
    { 0x21000000, "libRK" },
    { 0x22000000, "libRKC" },
    { 0x23000000, "libcanna" },
- Added the directory  "/usr/canna/dylib" for libRK, libRKC, and libcanna
  to checksyms (bug #61231).
- Made a hack to checksyms(l) that allows MH_DYLIB's and MH_FVMLIB's to have
  stabs as long as it does not have N_FUN symbols (stabs for functions)
  (bug #61231).
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding(1) which did not deal with indrect symbols
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL which were local symbols that were striped (bug #61232).
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding(1) which did not return the correct status
  if an input file was mallformed and fatal_arch() was called from checkout()
  or breakout().  The fix was to copy in the fatal_arch.c code and change
  the exit() call in fatal_arch to switch off check_for_non_prebound (-p) and
  exit(0) or exit(2) otherwise (bug #61232).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-183 release):
- Added the -dylib_table argument to checksyms.
- Changed checksyms to default to arch all if no -arch's are specified.
- Finished the redo_prebinding command and added it to cctools (bug #60110).
- Added an entry in the checksyms table for EOControl at address 0x1e000000.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-182 release):
- Added an entry in the checksyms table for libFaxD at address 0x1d000000.
  Added the directory /usr/lib/NextPrinter/ to be an allowed path.
- Added an entry in the checksyms table for libMallocDebug at address 0.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-181 release):
- Fixed a typo in the Makefile that made pagestuff from lipo.private.o
  (bug #59715).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-176 release):
- Fixed a bug in checksyms that did not deal with profile suffixed dylibs.
  Also added entries in the table for Message and libkeymap (bug #)
- Fixed a bug in strip in stripping objects with prebound undefined symbols
  (bug #58405).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-175 release):
- Changed the Makefile to ld -r builds because private externs were causing
  prebinding to fail because of overlap.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-173 release):
- Added passing -arch_multiple to ld from libtool when running for more than
  one architecture.  Also always pass -arch flag because even if the objects
  are thin dylib1.o maybe fat or of a different architecture.
- Updated strip to know about prebound undefined symbols so it would strip
  objects with such symbols correctly.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-172 release):
- Fixed a bug in nm that was not selecting prebound undefined symbols as
  undefined symbols when -u was used.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-168 release):
- Wrote the program pagestuff to replace pageSymbols.
- Fixed a typo in lipo "architecure" changed to "architecture" (bug #55959).
- Change the version numbers of dynamic library to the form X[.Y[.Z]] to match
  how next does versioning of it's projects.  This effected libtool(1), ld(1),
  otool(1), dyld, libstuff(version_number.c) and man pages for ld and libtool
  bug #55627).  In here the changes were in libtool.c .

Changes for the 4.0 PR1 release (the cctools-166.9 and cctools-168 releases):
- Checksyms by default should have been non-verbose.  The errors messages in
  check_dylib() should have only been produced when the -d (detail) flag was
  on (bug #55648).

Changes for the 4.0 PR1 release (the cctools-166.8 and cctools-168 releases):
- Updated checksyms to know about NIInterface, EOAccess, EOInterface, NeXTApps
  and NIAccess.  As well as changed the /LocalLibrary/Frameworks/ path to
  /NextLibrary/PrivateFrameworks/ (bug #55414).  Also now build this -static.
- Fixed bug #55337 in libtool(1) that parsed -read_only_relocs as
  -read-only-relocs.
- Fixed bug #55334 in checksyms(l) which did not check for the Versions
  directory correctly because of a copy and paste error.  Also all dylib errors
  are now fatal.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-167 release):
- Fixed bug #53766 in file(1) which incorrectly reported some fat files
  malformed.  The bug was in type_buf() where it was looping the load commands
  checking for non-stripped and the test to end the loop if looking past the
  end of the buffer was in the wrong place.  This caused the varaible ifile to
  get trashed when the symbol_table command was swapped and then the reads on
  that file descriptor failed.

Changes for the 4.0 PR1 release (the cctools-166.1 and cctools-167 releases):
- Fixed a bug in libtool for creating static libraries that did not set the
  toc time and mod time based on the time of the file system that the library
  was created on.  To do this it involved changing create_library() to record
  where the ar_date's of the toc archive headers were and rewriting them after
  the file was closed when it is first created using the mod time from the file
  system (bug #52612).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-165 release):
- Added passing -read-only-relocs through from libtool to ld.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-164 release):
- Fixed a bug in nm when -o is used on a dynamic library it did not print the
  name of the module on the line.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-161 release):
- Added an undocumented -v flag to nm(1) to be used with -n and -s to print the
  difference of the values of symbols.
- Changed Foundation's address in checksyms to 0x18000000.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-160 release):
- Update checksyms for dylib checking:
     checks names for these forms:
	/NextLibrary/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/A/Appkit
	/LocalLibrary/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/A/Appkit
	/lib/libsys_s.A.dylib
     checks for correct addresses
     checks for compatibility and current version being set
  Currently the error condition is commented out but the checking and printing
  of the error is done.  This is waiting on the corresponding changes in the
  app Makefiles.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-158 release):
- Changed the spelling of dynamicly to dynamically in file(1) (bug #51635).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-156 release):
- Fixed a bug in indr introduced by fixing the bug in stripping objects compiled
  with -dynamic.  The indr code did not deal with -dynamic objects either and
  had to be updated with what writeout() was doing when it had an object with
  a dynamic symbol table command.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-154 release):
- Fixed a bug in checksyms that did not ignore non-object files.  The call to
  ofile_process() had process_non_objects FALSE when it should have been TRUE.
- To fixed a bug in stripping .o files compiled dynamic.  The test in
  strip_object() needed to be changed to based on if there was a dynamic symbol
  table command in the object not on if it had MH_DYLDLINK in the mach header.
  Then the starting offset of the link edit info need to be based on the lowest
  offset if there wasn't a seg link edit command.  Also a change was made in
  libstuff's writeout.c
- Wrote a first cut at cmpdylib that compares global symbols and version 
  numbers.
- Added support for stripping defined externals that appear as indirect symbol
  table entries in non-lazy pointer sections.  Strip uses the values
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL and INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS to represent the symbols that
  are defined that were stripped.  The static link editor marks defined external
  symbols in the n_desc field with REFERENCED_DYNAMICALLY and the new -r flag
  saves these symbols.  For executables that use the dynamic linker and are
  stripped with no options the default is the same as -u -r.
  saves these symbols.  For executables that use the dynamic linker 
- Picked up kern_tool.
- Added to nm(1) printing of [referenced dynamically] for REFERENCED_DYNAMICALLY
  marked external symbols with -m.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-152 release):
- Fixed a problem with indr for dylibs with symbols listed in the indr list
  that are undefined in the library.  In this case the undefined symbol does
  not get it's name changed to include an '_'.
- Added -arch_only to libtool.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-150 release):
- Added the -i option to strip(1) to ignore symbols in the -s file that are not
  in the objects being stripped.
- Added -arch_indr to indr(l).
- Added passing -F and -framework ld(1) options through for libtool -dynamic.
- Changed how libtool -dynamic handles dependent dynamic shared libraries and
  does not use the architectures contained in them to determine which
  architectures are part of output.
- Changed checksyms to allow non-stab symbols in MH_DYLDLINK files.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-149 release):
- Added passing the -filelist list[,dirname] option through to ld (bug #50779).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-148 release):
- Added -extract_family to lipo to extract all architectures in that family.
  It creates a thin or fat file (bug #47499).
- Removed the hack in checksyms to not check dylinker files now that the
  dynamic linker can be installed stripped.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-147 release):
- Fixed a bug strip -x -S when a private extern was present it was not treated
  as a global.  This worked with -x but not with both -S and -x.
- Fixed a bug in nm that did not print dylibs symbol tables of the a different
  byte sex correctly.  select_symbols() was causing double swapping if called
  more than once.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-146 release):
- Fixed a problem with the bug fix in strip that did not update relocation
  entries correctly if there are paired relocation entries.  The bug fix did
  not acount for the relocation entry being a scattered relocation entry.  This
  problem was also in indr.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-145 release):
- Fixed bugs in size, strings and checksyms when the dylib "flat" argument was
  added it was switch.
- Fixed a bug in strip when striping a dylib and a defined symbol is being
  stripped and changed into an undefined symbol the undefined symbols were not
  sorted by name.
- Fixed a TODO in strip when attempting to strip a private extern symbol in a
  dylib that had reference table entries to it.  This is treated as an error as
  the static link editor relocated to these symbols and they can't be stripped.
- Added support in indr(l) for dylibs.
- Fixed a bug in strip that did not update relocation entries correctly if there
  are paired relocation entries.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-143 release):
- Added support in nm for printing the symbols of dylib modules and a -f (flat)
  switch for getting symbols as one Mach-O file.
- Added passing the "-U symbol", "-i_defined:_indr", "-undefined warning" flags
  through libtool to ld.  Also allowed no files if flags for sections from files
  or indirect symbols are present. 

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-141 release):
- Added the ld flag -no_arch_warnings for libtool -dynamic which prevents
  warnings for files which don't have the correct architecture for the -arch
  flag.
- Fixed the spelling of "compatibility" in the compatibility_version for dylibs.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-140 release):
- Added MH_BUNDLE to file(1).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-136 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip where with no options on dyld causes it to core dump.
  The change was to strip_object() in the case of no options if the input file
  has dynamic symbol table  and local relocation entries keep those relocation
  entries on output.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-134 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip that showed up when striping a 3.2 object that did not
  have the symbols in the 3.3 order.  The problem was the relocation entries
  did not get updated correctly because the saves[] array was not updated with
  the output symbol index after the symbols were ordered.
- Fixed a bug in strip that did not update N_INDR symbols correctly because it
  did not account for the string of the indirect symbol indexed by n_value.
  This bug was introduced in cctools-127 when strip was changed to handle
  objects with the dynamic symbol table information.  So it is not in the
  cctool-119 strip that is in the 3.2hp release (bug #44817).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-133 release):
- Fixed Makefile to do the mig stuff for libtool in a read-only SRCROOT.
- Fixed a problem in strip for cross byte sex striping when the dynamic
  symbol table info is present.  In strip.c the problem was the new symbolic
  tables were not swapped to the target byte sex.  And in writeout.c in libstuff
  the problem was that parts of the headers were used after they were swapped.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-132 release):
- Made libtool(1) with -dynamic ProjectBuilder aware and send it doing 
  messages (part of bug #40745).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-131 release):
- Changed strip to treat non-external private externs as global symbols and
  save them with -x or in the -s list file.
- Added "(was a private external)" to nm -m's printing non-external private
  externs.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-129 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip where it was free()'ing the new_* data structures it
  created.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-128 release):
- Fixed a bug strip in strip_object() where it was using object->dyst->nextrel
  without checking that object->dyst could be NULL.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-127 release):
- Major changes to strip.c to allow it to operate on objects with the dynamic
  symbol table layouts.  strip(1) now operates on MH_DYLIB files.
- nmedit(l) works with objects with the dynamic symbol table layouts but does
  not re-group globals turned into statics with local symbols.  It also does
  not operate on MH_DYLIB files.
- Fixed checksyms -r to not exit non-zero if there are no stabs.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-126 release):
- Changed strip -s <list> when processing an archive report errors in symbols
  not in <list> for each member but rather for the whole archive.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-125 release):
- Added -force_cpusubtype_ALL for libtool's -dynamic execution of ld(1).

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-124 release):
- Added a temporary hack to checksyms(1) to not check MH_DYLINKER files.
- Added a temporary error message in segedit.c: "current limitation, can't
  process files with LC_DYSYMTAB load command".
- Added a temporary error message in libstuff to check_object() in checkout.c
  to print the error "current limitation, can't process files with LC_DYSYMTAB
  load command" so that strip(1), nmedit(1) and indr(l) for now print a
  reasonable message when such a file is used.
- Added -dynamic to libtool to allow building dynamic shared libraries.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-119 release):
- Picked up the changes for lipo with respect to the sparc target.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-118 release):
- Fixed a bug that crashed strip when doing a strip -S on a library and a member
  had no symbol table command.  The bug was in writeout.c in libstuff at line
  490 where it indirected thought the pointer to the symbol table command
  without checking if it was NULL.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-116 release):
- Fixed a bug in nmedit that cleared the N_EXT bit from N_INDR symbols which it
  shouldn't have.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-115 release):
- Fixed a bug in lipo(1) that did not preserve set uid, set gid and sticky text
  file premision bits (bug #40266).

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-109 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) when multiple files were listed to strip it would
  fail with "can't create output file:****  (File exists)" where **** was blank
  or it cored dumped.  This was because the variable output_file was not
  correcly reset to NULL after it was free'ed.  The fix was to move the 
  free(output_file) into the else clause that also did the makestr() call and
  also set output_file to NULL after the free().  This is in strip.c in 
  strip_file() at the end of the routine.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-102 release):
- Integrated in the hppa support.
different misc/lipo.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37. Has hppa cpu stuff in it.
different misc/nm.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  Only comment typo change.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-100 release):
- First major round of changes for the new shlib stuff.
  1) In nm support for .private_extern directive with -m to print
     "private external".
- Fixed a bug where strip with the -S and -x ignored -x (bug #36206)
- Added the "-o output" option to strip (bug #36252)

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-22 release):
- Changed file to print out architecture for Mach-O file that were not fat and
  changed lipo -i to print architectures on one line (bug #31882).
- Added printing for these  (bug #32553):
    { "any",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_MULTIPLE },
    { "little",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_LITTLE_ENDIAN },
    { "big",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_BIG_ENDIAN },

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-21 release):
- Changed in lipo when "-arch i386 a.out" was used by the compiler and a.out
  turns out to be an i486 subtype lipo treated this as a hard error. A safe
  fix to this was made to remove the cpusubtype compare in check_arch() which
  matches what it does for archives.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-20 release):
- Put back -O in the Makefile (previously was removed because of m88k builds -O 
  could't be used on lipo.c because of a bug, this is now a non-issue).
- Added cross bytesex support for segedit(1) (still no fat support).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-17 release):
- Change made to strip to only generate a warning message when it encounters a
  non-object file an not stop processing other files (bug #23144).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-16 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool when stat_buf.st_gid is a negitive value it was casted
  to an unsigned int and sprintf()'ed with %o into a field that was expected to
  have only enough characters for a short (not a sign extended short).  The fix
  was to cast to a unsigned short (bug #30995).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-14 release):
- Removed the archive checking of subtype in check_archive() for lipo.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-13 release):
- Added the m98k (PowerPC) architecture (lipo only change).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-10 release):
- Changed the way the date is set on the output file when creating the output
  file with -c to only set the it to the oldest input date when an input file
  has an archive in it.
- Changed the handling of the cpusubtypes to support this design:
    The design allows each architecture family (m68k, m88k, i386) to have a
    cpusubtype that will run on all implementations of that architecture and
    have cpusubtypes that will run only on specific implementations of an
    architecture.  The design also gives the programmer the option to force the
    cpusubtype indicating all implementations (at build time with a flag) when
    using instructions that are implementation specific leaving it up to the
    program to runtime select the correct code to execute.
  The library creation tools (libtool and ranlib) operation in this design:
    When a library creation tool creates libraries objects of the same
    cputype and differing cpusubtypes it will create at most one library for
    each cputype and not a separate library in a fat file for each of the unique
    cputype and cpusubtype pairs.  The resulting cpusubtype for each library
    will be the _ALL cpusubtype for that cputype.  The goal is the library
    implementor should be strongly encouraged to create one library that
    chooses optimum code to run at run time rather than at link time.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-9 release):
- Added to lipo when the -info or -detailed_info is specified printing of
  architecture type for non-fat files (bug #29465).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-8 release):
- Changed the default for strip when no -arch flag is present to strip all
  archs (demanded by the NRW group).
- Removed ebadexec as the OS group has taken it over.
- Changed the checking in add_member() to only look at the cputype and not at
  both the cputype and cpusubtype (this will change as the correct handling of
  the cpusubtype is implemented).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-6 release):
- Moved segedit(1) from misc3.0 directory to here (misc) and added error
  recognition for fat files and cross bytesex Mach-O files (and cleaned up
  -Wall warning messages).
- Moved ebadexec(1) from misc3.0 directory to here (misc) and added error
  recognition for fat files (and cleaned up -Wall warning messages).
- Moved atom(1) from misc3.0 directory to here (misc) and cleaned up -Wall
  warning messages.
- Moved ar(1) from misc3.0 directory to here (misc) and added error recognition 
  for fat files (and cleaned up -Wall warning messages).
- Added fat and cross bytesex support for file(1).
- Fixed a bug in strip(l) that did not round the size of the string table to
  a multiple of 4 bytes.  This caused the object file to have odd sizes in some
  cases and produce trashed archives.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-5 release):
- Created a new version of indr(l), strip(1) and nmedit(l) that handles fat
  files and cross byte sex.  The new strip(1) handles libraries and does not
  treat already stripped objects as errors.
- Fixed a bug in libtool/ranlib that caused it to create the library even when
  there were errors.  This is no longer done.  If there is an error then the
  library is not created (or the table of contents is not recreated).
- Fixed a bug that caused problems in ranlib when an archive with a that
  contained both fat objects with multiple archives and non-object files was
  given as input.  The "correct" thing to do in this case in not known (which
  architecture archive the non-object file is to reside in in the output).  So
  this case is flagged as an error.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-4 release):
- Changed the arch name of ix86 to i386 in lipo.c
- Fixed a bug in libtool that caused it to crash when sprintf() was used and
  placed it's trailing '\0' past the end of the buffer.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-3 release):
- Changed CPU_TYPE_I80x86 to CPU_TYPE_I386 in lipo.c

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -56 compiler release):
- Changed print_argstrings() in otool.c to handle a core files that have more
  than just one '\0' after the long 0 on the top of the stack (bug #19645).

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -52 compiler release):
- Added LC_PREPAGE.  Just the string "LC_PREPAGE" and the cmdsize printed in
  otool.
- Fixed a bug where libtool was not setting the S_IFREG bits in the toc_mode.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -53 compiler release):
- Changed STACK_ADDR to USRSTACK from <bsd/m68k/vmparam.h> .

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -51 compiler release):
- Changed otool to print the m88k thread flavors for te new thread_status.h.
- Changed otool when looping through archives so not to complain when getting
  a short read on an archive header when an archive was passed to 4 bytes and
  the extra 2 bytes of padding was read as an archive header.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -50 compiler release):
- Changed the instructions f[sd]sqrtx for operands FPm,FPn and FPm to f[sd]sqrt
  (without the trailing 'x').  This was just wrong (but the moto opcode is
  inconsistant with all others in this case).
- Added an nm(1) that knows about fat files.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -49 compiler release):
- Changed where the 3.1 tools get installed, they now get installed in
  /usr/local/bin3.1 with there usual names (no 3.1 suffix).
- Fixed the printing of operands for the i860 to use external relocation
  entries correctly.
- Added the LC_FVMFILE to otool.
- Changed the Makefile to meet the RC api.
- Set this directory up for the 3.1 release (fat tools and 88k and ix86 tools).
