Changes for the 5.3 release (the cctools-285 release):
- Changed the Makefile to build libmacho.a, libmacho_pg.a and libmacho_static.a
  in $(DSTROOT)/Local/Developer/System for MacOS X, that is when $(RC_OS) is
  macos.  This to allow System framework to be built without using SUBLIBROOTS.
  Radar bug #2268413.

Changes for the 5.3 release, MacOS X bring up (the cctools-282 release):
- Changed swap_ppc_thread_state_t() to not use bit fields for srr1, cr and exr
  to match the ppc_thread_state for Rhapsody/MacOS X.
- Changed host_self() to mach_host_self() for MacOS X.  Also included
  "stuff/openstep_mach.h" for macros to allow it to still build on Openstep.
  Also changed ifdef's __SLICK__ to __OPENSTEP__.
- Changed the Makefile to allow for RC_OS=macos for MacOS X builds.
- Added a few casts in places to get it to compile with the MetroWerks compiler
  without -relax_pointers.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-277 release):
- Added code in NXGetArchInfoFromCpuType() for i386 and ppc to create an
  NXArchInfo struct with strings for unknown subtypes.  Radar bug #2241690.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-274 release):
- Removed uses of CPU_SUBTYPE_586SX from arch.c and added new intel subtypes.
  Updates NXFindBestFatArch() and NXCombineCpuSubtypes() from libstuff's
  version. Radar bug #2231830.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-268 release):
- Removed getmachhead.o from dylib.ofileList.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-267 release):
- Removed the -DDYLD_PROFILING flag from the Makefile which was left over when
  copying libdyld's Makefile.  Radar bug #2227782.
- Fixed some warnings from getsectdatafromFramework() code added.  Included
  "mach-o/dyld.h" in all DYNAMIC cases.  Also changed getsectbynamefromheader()
  to use const for segname and sectname.  Radar bug #2227839.
- Added getsectdatafromFramework() as per Radar 2151720.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-261 release):
- Added the PowerPC subtypes 603e, 603ev and 750 to the table of arch types.
  (Radar 2213821)
- Changed NXFindBestFatArch() in arch.c for PowerPC subtypes.  If an
  exact match is not found the subtype will be picked from the following order:
	750, 604e, 604, 603ev, 603e, 603, ALL
  Note the 601 is NOT in the list above.  It is only picked via an exact match.
  (Radar 2213821)
- Changed NXCombineCpuSubtypes() in arch.c for for PowerPC subtypes.
  Combining with the ALL type becomes the other type. Combining anything with
  the 601 becomes 601.  All other non exact matches combine to the ALL type.
  (Radar 2213821)

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-247 release):
- Fixed bugs in getsegbyname.c and getsecbyname.c on the ifdef __SLICK__ side
  where the mach header pointer was not set.  The missing line of code was:
	mhp = (struct mach_header *)(& USE_VAR(_mh_execute_header));
  This is the 4.2 Openstep side so these bugs don't really matter.
- Added MKDIRS if code to the Makefile to build native on Rhapsody.
- Changed the Makefile to use gnutar instead of tar because it works on Rhapsody
  where tar does not.
- Changed the Makefile so profiled objects get built for RC_OS teflon.
- Changed the code ifdef __TEFLON__ to ifndef __SLICK__ (where __TEFLON__ will
  nolonger be defined for Rhapsody builds) so the default builds will be native
  Rhapsody builds.  The changes were to get_end.c, getmachhead.c,
  getsecbyname.c and getsegbyname.c .

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-241 release):
- Added ppc604e to the arch table (Radar 1669413).

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-226 release):
- Added ppc604 to the arch table and to get_arch_from_host().  This is what
  the kernel on the Power Mac 8500 is returning.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-224 release):
- Added a sparc_swap.c and a ppc_swap.c.
  Added them to the Makefile and dylib.ofileList (but not the shlib.ofileList).
- Added i860_swap.c and a m88k_swap.c but did NOT add them to any ofileList.
- Pulled in hppa_swap.c, i386_swap.c, and m68k_swap.c from the libc_gen
  project.  Added them to the Makefile and dylib.ofileList (except hppa_swap.c)
  but not the shlib.ofileList.  Updated these files with the code from 
  libstuff's bytesex.c.
- Updated swap.c from libstuff's bytesex.c adding the following routines:
    swap_dysymtab_command()
    swap_dylib_command()
    swap_prebound_dylib_command()
    swap_dylinker_command()
    swap_indirect_symbols()
    swap_dylib_reference()
    swap_dylib_module()
    swap_dylib_table_of_contents()
- Updated arch.c by changing m98k to ppc and removed the never supported
  architectures (mips,and vax).  Also copied in the implementation of
  cpusubtype_findbestarch() from libstuff's best_arch.c into 
  NXFindBestFatArch() and likewise for cpusubtype_combine() into
  NXCombineCpuSubtypes().
- Fixed the type of headers in getmachheaders() in getmachhead.c to fix a
  warning.
- Fixed a warning in getsectdatafromlib() in getsecbyname.c.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-223 release):
- Put back changes ifndef'ed __TEFLON__ .

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-221.6 and cctools-222 releases):
- Picked up changes to get_end() in get_end.c to use _NSGetMachExecuteHeader().
- Picked up changes to getmachheaders() in getmachhead.c to use
  _NSGetMachExecuteHeader().
- Picked up changes to getsectbyname() and getsectdatafromlib() in
  getsecbyname.c to use _NSGetMachExecuteHeader().
- Picked up changes to getsegbyname() in getsegbyname.c to use
  _NSGetMachExecuteHeader().

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-221.1 and cctools-222 releases):
- Picked up changed to the Makefile to not build profile objects for teflon.
  This is because the PowerPC compiler core dumps with -pg.
