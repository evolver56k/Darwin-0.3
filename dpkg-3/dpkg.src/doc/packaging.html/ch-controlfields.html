Control files and their fields
</h1>

Many of the tools in the <kbd>dpkg</kbd> suite manipulate data in a common
format, known as control files.  Binary and source packages have
control data as do the <code>.changes</code> files which control the
installation of uploaded files, and <kbd>dpkg</kbd>'s internal databases
are in a similar format.
<hr>
<h2><A name="s4.1">
4.1 Syntax of control files
</A></h2>

A file consists of one or more paragraphs of fields.  The paragraphs
are separated by blank lines.  Some control files only allow one
paragraph; others allow several, in which case each paragraph often
refers to a different package.<P>

Each paragraph is a series of fields and values; each field consists
of a name, followed by a colon and the value.  It ends at the end of
the line.  Horizontal whitespace (spaces and tabs) may occur before or
after the value and is ignored there; it is conventional to put a
single space after the colon.<P>

Some fields' values may span several lines; in this case each
continuation line <em>must</em> start with a space or tab.  Any trailing
spaces or tabs at the end of individual lines of a field value are
ignored.<P>

Except where otherwise stated only a single line of data is allowed
and whitespace is not significant in a field body.  Whitespace may
never appear inside names (of packages, architectures, files or
anything else), version numbers or in between the characters of
multi-character version relationships.<P>

Field names are not case-sensitive, but it is usual to capitalise the
fields using mixed case as shown below.<P>

Blank lines, or lines consisting only of spaces and tabs, are not
allowed within field values or between fields - that would mean a new
paragraph.<P>

It is important to note that there are several fields which are
optional as far as <kbd>dpkg</kbd> and the related tools are concerned,
but which must appear in every Debian package, or whose omission may
cause problems.  When writing the control files for Debian packages
you <em>must</em> read the Debian policy manual in conjuction with the
details below and the list of fields for the particular file.
<hr>
<h2><A name="s4.2">
4.2 List of fields

</A></h2>
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Package">
4.2.1 <code>Package</code>
</A></h3>

The name of the binary package.  Package names consist of the
alphanumerics and <code>+</code> <code>-</code> <code>.</code> (plus, minus and full
stop).<A href="footnotes.html#13" name="fr13">[13]</A><P>

They must be at least two characters and must start with an
alphanumeric.  In current versions of dpkg they are sort of
case-sensitive<A href="footnotes.html#14" name="fr14">[14]</A>; use lowercase
package names unless the package you're building (or referring to, in
other fields) is already using uppercase.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Version">
4.2.2 <code>Version</code>
</A></h3>

This lists the source or binary package's version number - see <A href="ch-versions.html">Version numbering, chapter 5</A>.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Architecture">
4.2.3 <code>Architecture</code>
</A></h3>

This is the architecture string; it is a single word for the CPU
architecture.<P>

<kbd>dpkg</kbd> will check the declared architecture of a binary package
against its own compiled-in value before it installs it.<P>

The special value <code>all</code> indicates that the package is
architecture-independent.<P>

In the main <code>debian/control</code> file in the source package, or in
the source package control file <code>.dsc</code>, a list of architectures
(separated by spaces) is also allowed, as is the special value
<code>any</code>.  A list indicates that the source will build an
architecture-dependent package, and will only work correctly on the
listed architectures.  <code>any</code> indicates that though the source
package isn't dependent on any particular architecture and should
compile fine on any one, the binary package(s) produced are not
architecture-independent but will instead be specific to whatever the
current build architecture is.<P>

In a <code>.changes</code> file the <code>Architecture</code> field lists the
architecture(s) of the package(s) currently being uploaded.  This will
be a list; if the source for the package is being uploaded too the
special entry <code>source</code> is also present.<P>

The current build architecture can be determined using <code>dpkg
--print-architecture</code>.<A href="footnotes.html#15" name="fr15">[15]</A>
This value is automatically used by <kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> when
building the control file for a binary package for which the source
control information doesn't specify architecture <code>all</code>.<P>

There is a separate option, <code>--print-installation-architecture</code>,
for finding out what architecture <kbd>dpkg</kbd> is willing to install.
This information is also in the output of <code>dpkg --version</code>.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Maintainer">
4.2.4 <code>Maintainer</code>
</A></h3>

The package maintainer's name and email address.  The name should come
first, then the email address inside angle brackets <code>&lt;&gt;</code> (in
RFC822 format).<P>

If the maintainer's name contains a full stop then the whole field
will not work directly as an email address due to a misfeature in the
syntax specified in RFC822; a program using this field as an address
must check for this and correct the problem if necessary (for example
by putting the name in round brackets and moving it to the end, and
bringing the email address forward).<P>

In a <code>.changes</code> file or parsed changelog data this contains the
name and email address of the person responsible for the particular
version in question - this may not be the package's usual maintainer.<P>

This field is usually optional in as far as the <kbd>dpkg</kbd> are
concerned, but its absence when building packages usually generates a
warning.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Source">
4.2.5 <code>Source</code>
</A></h3>

This field identifies the source package name.<P>

In a main source control information or a <code>.changes</code> or <code>.dsc</code>
file or parsed changelog data this may contain only the name of the
source package.<P>

In the control file of a binary package (or in a <code>Packages</code> file)
it may be followed by a version number in parentheses.<A href="footnotes.html#16" name="fr16">[16]</A> This version number may be omitted (and is, by
<kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd>) if it has the same value as the <code>Version</code>
field of the binary package in question.  The field itself may be
omitted from a binary package control file when the source package has
the same name and version as the binary package.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s4.2.6">
4.2.6 Package interrelationship fields:
<code>Depends</code>, <code>Pre-Depends</code>, <code>Recommends</code>
<code>Suggests</code>, <code>Conflicts</code>, <code>Provides</code>, <code>Replaces</code>
</A></h3>

These fields describe the package's relationships with other packages.
Their syntax and semantics are described in <A href="ch-relationships.html">Declaring relationships between packages, chapter 8</A>.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Description">
4.2.7 <code>Description</code>
</A></h3>

In a binary package <code>Packages</code> file or main source control file
this field contains a description of the binary package, in a special
format.  See <A href="ch-descriptions.html">Descriptions of packages - the
<code>Description</code> field, chapter 7</A> for details.<P>

In a <code>.changes</code> file it contains a summary of the descriptions for
the packages being uploaded.  The part of the field before the first
newline is empty; thereafter each line has the name of a binary
package and the summary description line from that binary package.
Each line is indented by one space.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Essential">
4.2.8 <code>Essential</code>
</A></h3>

This is a boolean field which may occur only in the control file of a
binary package (or in the <code>Packages</code> file) or in a per-package
fields paragraph of a main source control data file.<P>

If set to <code>yes</code> then <kbd>dpkg</kbd> and <kbd>dselect</kbd> will refuse to
remove the package (though it can be upgraded and/or replaced).  The
other possible value is <code>no</code>, which is the same as not having the
field at all.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-classification">
4.2.9 <code>Section</code> and <code>Priority</code>
</A></h3>

These two fields classify the package.  The <code>Priority</code> represents
how important that it is that the user have it installed; the
<code>Section</code> represents an application area into which the package has
been classified.<P>

When they appear in the <code>debian/control</code> file these fields give
values for the section and priority subfields of the <code>Files</code> field
of the <code>.changes</code> file, and give defaults for the section and
priority of the binary packages.<P>

The section and priority are represented, though not as separate
fields, in the information for each file in the <A href="#s-f-Files"><code>Files</code></A> field of a <code>.changes</code> file.  The
section value in a <code>.changes</code> file is used to decide where to
install a package in the FTP archive.<P>

These fields are not used by by <kbd>dpkg</kbd> proper, but by
<kbd>dselect</kbd> when it sorts packages and selects defaults.  See the
Debian policy manual for the priorities in use and the criteria for
selecting the priority for a Debian package, and look at the Debian
FTP archive for a list of currently in-use priorities.<P>

These fields may appear in binary package control files, in which case
they provide a default value in case the <code>Packages</code> files are
missing the information.  <kbd>dpkg</kbd> and <kbd>dselect</kbd> will only use
the value from a <code>.deb</code> file if they have no other information; a
value listed in a <code>Packages</code> file will always take precedence.  By
default <kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd> does not include the section and
priority in the control file of a binary package - use the <code>-isp</code>,
<code>-is</code> or <code>-ip</code> options to achieve this effect.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Binary">
4.2.10 <code>Binary</code>
</A></h3>

This field is a list of binary packages.<P>

When it appears in the <code>.dsc</code> file it is the list of binary
packages which a source package can produce.  It does not necessarily
produce all of these binary packages for every architecture.  The
source control file doesn't contain details of which architectures are
appropriate for which of the binary packages.<P>

When it appears in a <code>.changes</code> file it lists the names of the
binary packages actually being uploaded.<P>

The syntax is a list of binary packages separated by
commas.<A href="footnotes.html#17" name="fr17">[17]</A>
Currently the packages must be separated using only spaces in the
<code>.changes</code> file.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Installed-Size">
4.2.11 <code>Installed-Size</code>
</A></h3>

This field appears in the control files of binary packages, and in the
<code>Packages</code> files.  It gives the total amount of disk space
required to install the named package.<P>

The disk space is represented in kilobytes as a simple decimal number.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Files">
4.2.12 <code>Files</code>
</A></h3>

This field contains a list of files with information about each one.
The exact information and syntax varies with the context.  In all
cases the the part of the field contents on the same line as the field
name is empty.  The remainder of the field is one line per file, each
line being indented by one space and containing a number of sub-fields
separated by spaces.<P>

In the <code>.dsc</code> (Debian source control) file each line contains the
MD5 checksum, size and filename of the tarfile and (if applicable)
diff file which make up the remainder of the source
package.<A href="footnotes.html#18" name="fr18">[18]</A> The exact forms of the filenames are described
in <A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#s-sourcearchives">Source packages as archives, section 3.3</A>.<P>

In the <code>.changes</code> file this contains one line per file being
uploaded.  Each line contains the MD5 checksum, size, section and
priority and the filename.  The section and priority are the values of
the corresponding fields in the main source control file - see <A href="#s-f-classification"><code>Section</code> and <code>Priority</code>, subsection 4.2.9</A>.  If no section or priority is specified then
<code>-</code> should be used, though section and priority values must be
specified for new packages to be installed properly.<P>

The special value <code>byhand</code> for the section in a <code>.changes</code> file
indicates that the file in question is not an ordinary package file
and must by installed by hand by the distribution maintainers.  If the
section is <code>byhand</code> the priority should be <code>-</code>.<P>

If a new Debian revision of a package is being shipped and no new
original source archive is being distributed the <code>.dsc</code> must still
contain the <code>Files</code> field entry for the original source archive
<code></code><var>package</var><code>-</code><var>upstream-version</var><code>.orig.tar.gz</code>, but the
<code>.changes</code> file should leave it out.  In this case the original
source archive on the distribution site must match exactly,
byte-for-byte, the original source archive which was used to generate
the <code>.dsc</code> file and diff which are being uploaded.

<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Standards-Version">
4.2.13 <code>Standards-Version</code>
</A></h3>

The most recent version of the standards (the <kbd>dpkg</kbd> programmers'
and policy manuals and associated texts) with which the package
complies.  This is updated manually when editing the source package to
conform to newer standards; it can sometimes be used to tell when a
package needs attention.<P>

Its format is the same as that of a version number except that no
epoch or Debian revision is allowed - see <A href="ch-versions.html">Version numbering, chapter 5</A>.

<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Distribution">
4.2.14 <code>Distribution</code>
</A></h3>

In a <code>.changes</code> file or parsed changelog output this contains the
(space-separated) name(s) of the distribution(s) where this version of
the package should be or was installed.  Distribution names follow the
rules for package names.  (See <A href="#s-f-Package"><code>Package</code>, subsection 4.2.1</A>).<P>

Current distribution values are:
<dl>
<dt><em>stable</em><dd>This is the current `released' version of Debian GNU/Linux.  A new
version is released approximately every 3 months after the
<em>development</em> code has been <em>frozen</em> for a month of testing.
Once the distribution is <em>stable</em> only major bug fixes are
allowed. When changes are made to this distribution, the minor version
number is increased (for example: 1.2 becomes 1.2.1 then 1.2.2, etc).
<p><dt><em>unstable</em><dd>This distribution value refers to the <em>developmental</em> part of the Debian
distribution tree. New packages, new upstream versions of packages and
bug fixes go into the <em>unstable</em> directory tree. Download
from this distribution at your own risk.
<p><dt><em>contrib</em><dd>The packages with this distribution value do not meet the criteria for
inclusion in the main Debian distribution as defined by the Policy
Manual, but meet the criteria for the <em>contrib</em> Distribution. There
is currently no distinction between stable and unstable packages in
the <em>contrib</em> or <em>non-free</em> distributions. Use your best
judgement in downloading from this Distribution.
<p><dt><em>non-free</em><dd>Like the packages in the <em>contrib</em> seciton, the packages in
<em>non-free</em> do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the main
Debian distribution as defined by the Policy Manual. Again, use your
best judgement in downloading from this Distribution.
<p><dt><em>experimental</em><dd>The packages with this distribution value are deemed by their
maintainers to be high risk. Oftentimes they represent early beta or
developmental packages from various sources that the maintainers want
people to try, but are not ready to be a part of the other parts of
the Debian distribution tree. Download at your own risk.
<p><dt><em>frozen</em><dd>From time to time, (currently, every 3 months) the <em>unstable</em>
distribution enters a state of `code-freeze' in anticipation of
release as a <em>stable</em> version. During this period of testing
(usually 4 weeks) only fixes for existing or newly-discovered bugs
will be allowed.
<p></dl>
<P>
You should list <em>all</em> distributions that the package should be
installed into. Except in unusual circumstances, installations to
<em>stable</em> should also go into <em>frozen</em> (if it exists) and
<em>unstable</em>. Likewise, installations into <em>frozen</em> should also go
into <em>unstable</em>.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Urgency">
4.2.15 <code>Urgency</code>
</A></h3>

This is a description of how important it is to upgrade to this
version from previous ones.  It consists of a single keyword usually
taking one of the values <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code> or <code>HIGH</code>) followed
by an optional commentary (separated by a space) which is usually in
parentheses.  For example:
<pre>Urgency: LOW (HIGH for diversions users)</pre><P>

This field appears in the <code>.changes</code> file and in parsed changelogs;
its value appears as the value of the <code>urgency</code> attribute in a
<kbd>dpkg</kbd>-style changelog (see <A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#s-dpkgchangelog"><code>debian/changelog</code>, subsection 3.2.3</A>).<P>

Urgency keywords are not case-sensitive.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Date">
4.2.16 <code>Date</code>
</A></h3>

In <code>.changes</code> files and parsed changelogs, this gives the date the
package was built or last edited.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Format">
4.2.17 <code>Format</code>
</A></h3>

This field occurs in <code>.changes</code> files, and specifies a format
revision for the file.  The format described here is version <code>1.5</code>.
The syntax of the format value is the same as that of a package
version number except that no epoch or Debian revision is allowed -
see <A href="ch-versions.html">Version numbering, chapter 5</A>.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Changes">
4.2.18 <code>Changes</code>
</A></h3>

In a <code>.changes</code> file or parsed changelog this field contains the
human-readable changes data, describing the differences between the
last version and the current one.<P>

There should be nothing in this field before the first newline; all
the subsequent lines must be indented by at least one space; blank
lines must be represented by a line consiting only of a space and a
full stop.<P>

Each version's change information should be preceded by a `title' line
giving at least the version, distribution(s) and urgency, in a
human-readable way.<P>

If data from several versions is being returned the entry for the most
recent version should be returned first, and entries should be
separated by the representation of a blank line (the `title' line may
also be followed by the representation of blank line).
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Filename">
4.2.19 <code>Filename</code> and <code>MSDOS-Filename</code>
</A></h3>

These fields in <code>Packages</code> files give the filename(s) of (the parts
of) a package in the distribution directories, relative to the root of
the Debian hierarchy.  If the package has been split into several
parts the parts are all listed in order, separated by spaces.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Size">
4.2.20 <code>Size</code> and <code>MD5sum</code>
</A></h3>

These fields in <code>Packages</code> files give the size (in bytes, expressed
in decimal) and MD5 checksum of the file(s) which make(s) up a binary
package in the distribution.  If the package is split into several
parts the values for the parts are listed in order, separated by
spaces.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Status">
4.2.21 <code>Status</code>
</A></h3>

This field in <kbd>dpkg</kbd>'s status file records whether the user wants a
package installed, removed or left alone, whether it is broken
(requiring reinstallation) or not and what its current state on the
system is.  Each of these pieces of information is a single word.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Config-Version">
4.2.22 <code>Config-Version</code>
</A></h3>

If a package is not installed or not configured, this field in
<kbd>dpkg</kbd>'s status file records the last version of the package which
was successfully configured.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-f-Conffiles">
4.2.23 <code>Conffiles</code>
</A></h3>

This field in <kbd>dpkg</kbd>'s status file contains information about the
automatically-managed configuration files held by a package.  This
field should <em>not</em> appear anywhere in a package!
<hr>
<h3><A name="s4.2.24">
4.2.24 Obsolete fields
</A></h3>

These are still recognised by <kbd>dpkg</kbd> but should not appear anywhere
any more.

<dl compact>
<dt><code>Revision</code><dt><code>Package-Revision</code><dt><code>Package_Revision</code><dd>The Debian revision part of the package version was at one point in a
separate control file field.  This field went through several names.
<dt><code>Recommended</code><dd>Old name for <code>Recommends</code>
<dt><code>Optional</code><dd>Old name for <code>Suggests</code>.
<dt><code>Class</code><dd>Old name for <code>Priority</code>.
