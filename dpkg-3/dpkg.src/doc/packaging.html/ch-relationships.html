Declaring relationships between packages
</h1>

Packages can declare in their control file that they have certain
relationships to other packages - for example, that they may not be
installed at the same time as certain other packages, and/or that they
depend on the presence of others, or that they should overwrite files
in certain other packages if present.<P>

This is done using the <code>Depends</code>, <code>Recommends</code>, <code>Suggests</code>,
<code>Conflicts</code>, <code>Provides</code> and <code>Replaces</code> control file fields.<P>
<hr>
<h2><A name="s-depsyntax">
8.1 Syntax of relationship fields
</A></h2>

These fields all have a uniform syntax.  They are a list of package
names separated by commas.<P>

In <code>Depends</code>, <code>Recommends</code>, <code>Suggests</code> and <code>Pre-Depends</code>
(the fields which declare dependencies of the package in which they
occur on other packages) these package names may also be lists of
alternative package names, separated by vertical bar symbols <code>|</code>
(pipe symbols).<P>

All the fields except <code>Provides</code> may restrict their applicability
to particular versions of each named package.  This is done in
parentheses after each individual package name; the parentheses should
contain a relation from the list below followed by a version number,
in the format described in <A href="ch-versions.html">Version numbering, chapter 5</A>.<P>

The relations allowed are
<code>&lt;&lt;</code>,
<code>&lt;=</code>,
<code>=</code>,
<code>&gt;=</code> and
<code>&gt;&gt;</code>
for strictly earlier, earlier or equal, exactly equal, later or equal
and strictly later, respectively.  The forms <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>
were used to mean earlier/later or equal, rather than strictly
earlier/later, so they should not appear in new packages (though
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> still supports them).<P>

Whitespace may appear at any point in the version specification, and
must appear where it's necessary to disambiguate; it is not otherwise
significant.  For consistency and in case of future changes to
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> it is recommended that a single space be used after a
version relationship and before a version number; it is usual also to
put a single space after each comma, on either side of each vertical
bar, and before each open parenthesis.<P>

For example:
<pre>Package: metamail
Version: 2.7-3
Depends: libc5 (&gt;= 5.2.18-4), mime-support, csh | tcsh</pre>
<hr>
<h2><A name="s8.2">
8.2 Dependencies - <code>Depends</code>, <code>Recommends</code>, <code>Suggests</code>, <code>Pre-Depends</code>
</A></h2>

These four fields are used to declare a dependency by one package on
another.  They appear in the depending package's control file.<P>

All but <code>Pre-Depends</code> (discussed below) take effect <em>only</em> when
a package is to be configured.  They do not prevent a package being on
the system in an unconfigured state while its dependencies are
unsatisfied, and it is possible to replace a package whose
dependencies are satisfied and which is properly installed with a
different version whose dependencies are not and cannot be satisfied;
when this is done the depending package will be left unconfigured
(since attempts to configure it will give errors) and will not
function properly.<P>

For this reason packages in an installation run are usually all
unpacked first and all configured later; this gives later versions of
packages with dependencies on later versions of other packages the
opportunity to have their dependencies satisfied.<P>

Thus <code>Depends</code> allows package maintainers to impose an order in
which packages should be configured.

<dl>
<dt><code>Depends</code><dd>This declares an absolute dependency.<P>

<kbd>dpkg</kbd> will not configure
packages whose dependencies aren't satisfied.  If it is asked to make
an installation which would cause an installed package's dependencies
to become unsatisfied it will complain<A href="footnotes.html#21" name="fr21">[21]</A>, unless
<code>--auto-deconfigure</code> is specified, in which case those packages
will be deconfigured before the installation proceeds.<P>

<kbd>dselect</kbd> makes it hard for the user to select packages for
installation, removal or upgrade in a way that would mean that
packages' <kbd>Depends</kbd> fields would be unsatisfied.  The user can
override this if they wish, for example if they know that <kbd>dselect</kbd>
has an out-of-date view of the real package relationships.<P>

The <code>Depends</code> field should be used if the depended-on package is
required for the depending package to provide a significant amount of
functionality.
<p><dt><code>Recommends</code><dd>This declares a strong, but not absolute, dependency.<P>

<code>Recommends</code> is ignored by <kbd>dpkg</kbd>, so that users using the
command-line (who are presumed to know what they're doing) will not be
impeded.<P>

It is treated by <kbd>dselect</kbd> exactly as <code>Depends</code> is; this makes
it hard for the user to select things so as to leave <code>Recommends</code>
fields unsatisfied, but they are able to do so by being persistent.<P>

The <code>Recommends</code> field should list packages that would be found
together with this one in all but unusual installations.
<p><dt><code>Suggests</code><dd>This is used to declare that one package may be more useful with one
or more others.  Using this field tells the packaging system and the
user that the listed packages are be related to this one and can
perhaps enhance its usefulness, but that installing this one without
them is perfectly reasonable.<P>

<kbd>dselect</kbd> will offer suggsted packages to the system administrator
when they select the suggesting package, but the default is not to
install the suggested package.
<p><dt><code>Pre-Depends</code><dd>This field is like <code>Depends</code>, except that it also forces <kbd>dpkg</kbd>
to complete installation of the packages named before even starting
the installation of the package which declares the predependency.<P>

<kbd>dselect</kbd> checks for predependencies when it is doing an
installation run, and will attempt to find the packages which are
required to be installed first and do so in the right order.<P>

However, this process is slow (because it requires repeated
invocations of <kbd>dpkg</kbd>) and troublesome (because it requires
guessing where to find the appropriate files).<P>

For these reasons, and because this field imposes restrictions on the
order in which packages may be unpacked (which can be difficult for
installations from multipart media, for example), <code>Pre-Depends</code>
should be used sparingly, preferably only by packages whose premature
upgrade or installation would hamper the ability of the system to
continue with any upgrade that might be in progress.<P>

When the package declaring it is being configured, a
<code>Pre-Dependency</code> will be considered satisfied only if the depending
package has been correctly configured, just as if an ordinary
<code>Depends</code> had been used.<P>

However, when a package declaring a predependency is being unpacked
the predependency can be satisfied even if the depended-on package(s)
are only unpacked or half-configured, provided that they have been
configured correctly at some point in the past (and not removed or
partially removed since).  In this case both the previously-configured
and currently unpacked or half-configured versions must satisfy any
version clause in the <code>Pre-Depends</code> field.
<p></dl>


When selecting which level of dependency to use you should consider
how important the depended-on package is to the functionality of the
one declaring the dependency.  Some packages are composed of
components of varying degrees of importance.  Such a package should
list using <code>Depends</code> the package(s) which are required by the more
important components.  The other components' requirements may be
mentioned as Suggestions or Recommendations, as appropriate to the
components' relative importance.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s8.2.1">
8.2.1 Dependencies on shared libraries
</A></h3>

The dependency fields listed above are used by packages which need
shared libraries to declare dependencies on the appropriate packages.<P>

These dependencies are usually determined automatically using
<kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> and inserted in the package control file using
the control file substitution variables mechanism; see <A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#s-srcsubstvars"><code>debian/substvars</code> and variable substitutions, subsection 3.2.4</A> and <A href="ch-sourcepkg.html#s-sourcetools">Tools for processing source packages, section 3.1</A>.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s8.2.2">
8.2.2 Deconfiguration due to removal during bulk installations
</A></h3>

If <kbd>dpkg</kbd> would like to remove a package due to a conflict, as
described above, but this would violate a dependency of some other
package on the system, <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will usually not remove the
conflicting package and halt with an error.<P>

However, if the <code>--auto-deconfigure</code> (<code>-B</code>) option is used
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> will automatically `deconfigure' the package with the
problematic dependency, so that the conflicting package can be removed
and the package we're trying to install can be installed.  If
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> is being asked to install packages (rather than just
unpacking them) it will try to reconfigure the package when it has
unpacked all its arguments, in the hope that one of the other packages
it is installing will satisfy the problematic dependency.<P>

<kbd>dselect</kbd> supplies this argument to <kbd>dpkg</kbd> when it invokes it,
so that bulk installations proceed smoothly.
<hr>
<h2><A name="s-conflicts">
8.3 Alternative packages - <code>Conflicts</code> and <code>Replaces</code>
</A></h2>

When one package declares a conflict with another <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will
refuse to allow them to be installed on the system at the same time.<P>

If one package is to be installed, the other must be removed first -
if the package being installed is marked as replacing (<A href="#s-replaces"><code>Replaces</code> - overwriting files and replacing packages, section 8.5</A>) the one on the system, or the one on the system is
marked as deselected, or both packages are marked <code>Essential</code>, then
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> will automatically remove the package which is causing the
conflict, otherwise it will halt the installation of the new package
with an error.<P>

<kbd>dselect</kbd> makes it hard to select conflicting packages, though the
user can override this if they wish.  If they do not override it then
<kbd>dselect</kbd> will select one of the packages for removal, and the user
must make sure it is the right one.  In the future <kbd>dselect</kbd> will
look for the presence of a <code>Replaces</code> field to help decide which
package should be installed and which removed.<P>

A package will not cause a conflict merely because its configuration
files are still installed; it must be at least half-installed.<P>

A special exception is made for packages which declare a conflict with
their own package name, or with a virtual package which they provide
(see below): this does not prevent their installation, and allows a
package to conflict with others providing a replacement for it.  You
use this feature when you want the package in question to be the only
package providing something.<P>

A <code>Conflicts</code> entry should almost never have an `earlier than'
version clause.  This would prevent <kbd>dpkg</kbd> from upgrading or
installing the package which declared such a conflict until the
upgrade or removal of the conflicted-with package had been completed.
This aspect of installation ordering is not handled by <kbd>dselect</kbd>,
so that the use <code>Conflicts</code> in this way is likely to cause problems
for `bulk run' upgrades and installations.<P>

<hr>
<h2><A name="s-virtual">
8.4 Virtual packages - <code>Provides</code>
</A></h2>

As well as the names of actual (`concrete') packages, the package
relationship fields <code>Depends</code>, <code>Recommends</code>, <code>Suggests</code> and
<code>Conflicts</code> may mention virtual packages.<P>

A virtual package is one which appears in the <code>Provides</code> control
file field of another package.  The effect is as if the package(s)
which provide a particular virtual package name had been listed by
name everywhere were the virtual package name appears.<P>

If there are both a real and a virtual package of the same name then
the dependency may be satisfied (or the conflict caused) by either the
real package or any of the virtual packages which provide it.  This is
so that, for example, supposing we have
<pre>Package: vm
Depends: emacs</pre>
and someone else releases an xemacs package they can say
<pre>Package: xemacs
Provides: emacs</pre>
and all will work in the interim (until a purely virtual package name
is decided on and the <code>emacs</code> and <code>vm</code> packages are changed to
use it).<P>

If a dependency or a conflict has a version number attached then only
real packages will be considered to see whether the relationship is
satisfied (or the prohibition violated, for a conflict) - it is
assumed that a real package which provides virtual package is not of
the `right' version.  So, a <code>Provides</code> field may not contain
version numbers, and the version number of the concrete package which
provides a particular virtual package will not be looked at when
considering a dependency on or conflict with the virtual package name.<P>

It is likely that the ability will be added in a future release of
<kbd>dpkg</kbd> to specify a version number for each virtual package it
provides.  This feature is not yet present, however, and is expected
to be used only infrequently.<P>

If you want to specify which of a set of real packages should be the
default to satisfy a particular dependency on a virtual package, you
should list the real package as alternative before the virtual.<P>

<hr>
<h2><A name="s-replaces">
8.5 <code>Replaces</code> - overwriting files and replacing packages
</A></h2>

The <code>Replaces</code> control file field has two purposes, which come into
play in different situations.<P>

Virtual packages (<A href="#s-virtual">Virtual packages - <code>Provides</code>, section 8.4</A>) are not considered when looking
at a <code>Replaces</code> field - the packages declared as being replaced
must be mentioned by their real names.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s8.5.1">
8.5.1 Overwriting files in other packages
</A></h3>

Firstly, as mentioned before, it is usually an error for a package to
contains files which are on the system in another package, though
currently the <code>--force-overwrite</code> flag is enabled by default,
downgrading the error to a warning,<P>

If the overwriting package declares that it replaces the one
containing the file being overwritten then <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will proceed, and
replace the file from the old package with that from the new.  The
file will no longer be listed as `owned' by the old package.<P>

If a package is completely replaced in this way, so that <kbd>dpkg</kbd>
does not know of any files it still contains, it is considered to have
disappeared.  It will be marked as not wanted on the system (selected
for removal) and not installed.  Any conffiles details noted in the
package will be ignored, as they will have been taken over by the
replacing package(s).  The package's <kbd>postrm</kbd> script will be run to
allow the package to do any final cleanup required.
See <A href="ch-maintainerscripts.html#s-mscriptsinstact">Summary of ways maintainer scripts are called, section 6.2</A>.<P>

In the future <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will discard files which overwrite those from
another package which declares that it replaces the one being
installed (so that you can install an older version of a package
without problems).<P>

This usage of <code>Replaces</code> only takes effect when both packages are
at least partially on the system at once, so that it can only happen
if they do not conflict or if the conflict has been overridden.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s8.5.2">
8.5.2 Replacing whole packages, forcing their removal
</A></h3>

Secondly, <code>Replaces</code> allows <kbd>dpkg</kbd> and <kbd>dselect</kbd> to resolve
which package should be removed when a conflict - see
<A href="#s-conflicts">Alternative packages - <code>Conflicts</code> and <code>Replaces</code>, section 8.3</A>.  This usage only takes effect when the two
packages <em>do</em> conflict, so that the two effects do not interfere
with each other.<P>
<hr>
<h2><A name="s8.6">
8.6 Defaults for satisfying dependencies - ordering
</A></h2>

Ordering is significant in dependency fields.<P>

Usually dselect will suggest to the user that they select the package
with the most `fundamental' class (eg, it will prefer Base packages to
Optional ones), or the one that they `most wanted' to select in some
sense.<P>

In the absence of other information <kbd>dselect</kbd> will offer a
default selection of the first named package in a list of
alternatives.<P>

However, there is no way to specify the `order' of several packages
which all provide the same thing, when that thing is listed as a
dependency.<P>

Therefore a dependency on a virtual package should contain a concrete
package name as the first alternative, so that this is the default.<P>

For example, consider the set of packages:

<pre>Package: glibcdoc
Recommends: info-browser

Package: info
Provides: info-browser

Package: emacs
Provides: info-browser</pre><P>

If <kbd>emacs</kbd> and <kbd>info</kbd> both have the same priority then
<kbd>dselect</kbd>'s choice is essentially random.  Better would be
<pre>Package: glibcdoc
Recommends: info | info-browser</pre>
so that <kbd>dselect</kbd> defaults to selecting the lightweight standalone
info browser.
