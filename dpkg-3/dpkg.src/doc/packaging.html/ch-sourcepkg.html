Debian packaging manual - chapter 3<br>
Source packages
</h1>

The Debian binary packages in the distribution are generated from
Debian sources, which are in a special format to assist the easy and
automatic building of binaries.<P>

There was a previous version of the Debian source format, which is now
being phased out.  Instructions for converting an old-style package
are given in the Debian policy manual.
<hr>
<h2><A name="s-sourcetools">
3.1 Tools for processing source packages
</A></h2>

Various tools are provided for manipulating source packages; they pack
and unpack sources and help build of binary packages and help manage
the distribution of new versions.<P>

They are introduced and typical uses described here; see <code>dpkg-source(1)</code> for full documentation about their
arguments and operation.<P>

For examples of how to construct a Debian source package, and how to
use those utilities that are used by Debian source packages, please
see the <kbd>hello</kbd> example package.

<h3><A name="s3.1.1">
3.1.1 <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> - packs and unpacks Debian source packages
</A></h3>

This program is frequently used by hand, and is also called from
package-independent automated building scripts such as
<kbd>dpkg-buildpackage</kbd>.<P>

To unpack a package it is typically invoked with
<pre>dpkg-source -x <var>.../path/to/filename</var>.dsc</pre>
with the <code></code><var>filename</var><code>.tar.gz</code> and
<code></code><var>filename</var><code>.diff.gz</code> (if applicable) in the same directory.  It
unpacks into <code></code><var>package</var><code>-</code><var>version</var><code></code>, and if applicable
<code></code><var>package</var><code>-</code><var>version</var><code>.orig</code>, in the current directory.<P>

To create a packed source archive it is typically invoked:
<pre>dpkg-source -b <var>package</var>-<var>version</var></pre>
This will create the <code>.dsc</code>, <code>.tar.gz</code> and <code>.diff.gz</code> (if
appropriate) in the current directory.  <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> does not
clean the source tree first - this must be done separately if it is
required.<P>

See also <A href="#s-sourcearchives">Source packages as archives, section 3.3</A>.

<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.1.2">
3.1.2 <kbd>dpkg-buildpackage</kbd> - overall package-building control
script
</A></h3>

<kbd>dpkg-buildpackage</kbd> is a script which invokes <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd>,
the <code>debian/rules</code> targets <kbd>clean</kbd>, <kbd>build</kbd> and
<kbd>binary</kbd>, <kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd> and <kbd>pgp</kbd> to build a signed
source and binary package upload.<P>

It is usually invoked by hand from the top level of the built or
unbuilt source directory.  It may be invoked with no arguments; useful
arguments include:
<dl compact>
<dt><code>-uc</code>, <code>-us</code><dd>Do not PGP-sign the <code>.changes</code> file or the source package
<code>.dsc</code> file, respectively.
<dt><code>-p</code><var>pgp-command</var><code></code><dd>Invoke <var>pgp-command</var> instead of finding <code>pgp</code> on the
<kbd>PATH</kbd>.  <var>pgp-command</var> must behave just like <kbd>pgp</kbd>.
<dt><code>-r</code><var>root-command</var><code></code><dd>When root privilege is required, invoke the command
<var>root-command</var>.  <var>root-command</var> should invoke its first
argument as a command, from the <kbd>PATH</kbd> if necessary, and pass its
second and subsequent arguments to the command it calls.  If no
<var>root-command</var> is supplied then <var>dpkg-buildpackage</var> will take
no special action to gain root privilege, so that for most packages it
will have to be invoked as root to start with.
<dt><code>-b</code>, <code>-B</code><dd>Two types of binary-only build and upload - see <code>dpkg-source(1)</code>.</dl>


<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.1.3">
3.1.3 <kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> - generates binary package control files
</A></h3>

This program is usually called from <code>debian/rules</code> (see <A href="#s-sourcetree">The Debianised source tree, section 3.2</A>) in the top level of the source tree.<P>

This is usually done just before the files and directories in the
temporary directory tree where the package is being built have their
permissions and ownerships set and the package is constructed using
<kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd><A href="footnotes.html#4" name="fr4">[4]</A>.<P>

<kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> must be called after all the files which are to
go into the package have been placed in the temporary build directory,
so that its calculation of the installed size of a package is correct.<P>

It is also necessary for <kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> to be run after
<kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> so that the variable substitutions created by
<kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> in <code>debian/substvars</code> are available.<P>

For a package which generates only one binary package, and which
builds it in <code>debian/tmp</code> relative to the top of the source
package, it is usually sufficient to call:
<pre>dpkg-gencontrol</pre><P>

Sources which build several binaries will typically need something
like:
<pre>dpkg-gencontrol -Pdebian/tmp-<var>pkg</var> -p<var>package</var></pre>
The <code>-P</code> tells <kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> that the package is being
built in a non-default directory, and the <code>-p</code> tells it which
package's control file should be generated.<P>

<kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> also adds information to the list of files in
<code>debian/files</code>, for the benefit of (for example) a future
invocation of <kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd>.

<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.1.4">
3.1.4 <kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> - calculates shared library dependencies
</A></h3>

This program is usually called from <code>debian/rules</code> just before
<kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> (see <A href="#s-sourcetree">The Debianised source tree, section 3.2</A>), in the top level
of the source tree.<P>

Its arguments are executables<A href="footnotes.html#5" name="fr5">[5]</A> for which shared library
dependencies should be included in the binary package's control file.<P>

If some of the executable(s) shared libraries should only warrant a
<code>Recommends</code> or <code>Suggests</code>, or if some warrant a
<code>Pre-Depends</code>, this can be achieved by using the
<code>-d</code><var>dependency-field</var><code></code> option before those executable(s).
(Each <code>-d</code> option takes effect until the next <code>-d</code>.)<P>

<kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> does not directly cause the output control file
to be modified.  Instead by default it adds to the
<code>debian/substvars</code> file variable settings like
<code>shlibs:Depends</code>.  These variable settings must be referenced in
dependency fields in the appropriate per-binary-package sections of
the source control file.<P>

For example, the <kbd>procps</kbd> package generates two kinds of
binaries, simple C binaries like <kbd>ps</kbd> which require a
predependency and full-screen ncurses binaries like <kbd>top</kbd> which
require only a recommendation.  It can say in its <code>debian/rules</code>:
<pre>dpkg-shlibdeps -dPre-Depends ps -dRecommends top</pre>
and then in its main control file <code>debian/control</code>:
<pre><var>...</var>
Package: procps
Pre-Depends: ${shlibs:Pre-Depends}
Recommends: ${shlibs:Recommends}
<var>...</var></pre><P>

Sources which produce several binary packages with different shared
library dependency requirements can use the <code>-p</code><var>varnameprefix</var><code></code>
option to override the default <code>shlib:</code> prefix (one invocation of
<kbd>dpkg-shlibdeps</kbd> per setting of this option).  They can thus
produce several sets of dependency variables, each of the form
<code></code><var>varnameprefix</var><code>:</code><var>dependencyfield</var><code></code>, which can be referred
to in the appropriate parts of the binary package control files.

<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.1.5">
3.1.5 <kbd>dpkg-distaddfile</kbd> - adds a file to <code>debian/files</code>
</A></h3>

Some packages' uploads need to include files other than the source and
binary package files.<P>

<kbd>dpkg-distaddfile</kbd> adds a file to the <code>debian/files</code> file so
that it will be included in the <code>.changes</code> file when
<kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd> is run.<P>

It is usually invoked from the <kbd>binary</kbd> target of
<code>debian/rules</code>:
<pre>dpkg-distaddfile <var>filename</var> <var>section</var> <var>priority</var></pre>
The <var>filename</var> is relative to the directory where
<kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd> will expect to find it - this is usually the
directory above the top level of the source tree.  The
<code>debian/rules</code> target should put the file there just before or
just after calling <kbd>dpkg-distaddfile</kbd>.<P>

The <var>section</var> and <var>priority</var> are passed unchanged into the
resulting <code>.changes</code> file.  See <A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-classification"><code>Section</code> and <code>Priority</code>, subsection 4.2.9</A>.

<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.1.6">
3.1.6 <kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd> - generates a <code>.changes</code> upload
control file
</A></h3>

This program is usually called by package-independent automatic
building scripts such as <kbd>dpkg-buildpackage</kbd>, but it may also be
called by hand.<P>

It is usually called in the top level of a built source tree, and when
invoked with no arguments will print out a straightforward
<code>.changes</code> file based on the information in the source package's
changelog and control file and the binary and source packages which
should have been built.

<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.1.7">
3.1.7 <kbd>dpkg-parsechangelog</kbd> - produces parsed representation of
a changelog
</A></h3>

This program is used internally by <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> et al.  It may
also occasionally be useful in <code>debian/rules</code> and elsewhere.  It
parses a changelog, <code>debian/changelog</code> by default, and prints a
control-file format representation of the information in it to
standard output.
<hr>
<h2><A name="s-sourcetree">
3.2 The Debianised source tree
</A></h2>

The source archive scheme described later is intended to allow a
Debianised source tree with some associated control information to be
reproduced and transported easily.  The Debianised source tree is a
version of the original program with certain files added for the
benefit of the Debianisation process, and with any other changes
required made to the rest of the source code and installation scripts.<P>

The extra files created for Debian are in the subdirectory <code>debian</code>
of the top level of the Debianised source tree.  They are described
below.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.2.1">
3.2.1 <code>debian/rules</code> - the main building script
</A></h3>

This file is an executable makefile, and contains the package-specific
recipies for compiling the package and building binary package(s) out
of the source.<P>

It must start with the line <code>#!/usr/bin/make -f</code>, so that it
can be invoked by saying its name rather than invoking <kbd>make</kbd>
explicitly.<P>

The targets which are required to be present are:

<dl>
<dt><code>build</code><dd>This should perform all non-interactive configuration and compilation
of the package.  If a package has an interactive pre-build
configuration routine, the Debianised source package should be built
after this has taken place, so that it can be built without rerunning
the configuration.<P>

For some packages, notably ones where the same source tree is compiled
in different ways to produce two binary packages, the <kbd>build</kbd>
target does not make much sense.  For these packages it is good enough
to provide two (or more) targets (<code>build-a</code> and <code>build-b</code> or
whatever) for each of the ways of building the package, and a
<kbd>build</kbd> target that does nothing.  The <kbd>binary</kbd> target will have
to build the package in each of the possible ways and make the binary
package out of each.<P>

The <kbd>build</kbd> target must not do anything that might require root
privilege.<P>

The <kbd>build</kbd> target may need to run <kbd>clean</kbd> first - see below.<P>

When a package has a configuration routine that takes a long time, or
when the makefiles are poorly designed, or when <kbd>build</kbd> needs to
run <kbd>clean</kbd> first, it is a good idea to <code>touch build</code> when the
build process is complete.  This will ensure that if <code>debian/rules
build</code> is run again it will not rebuild the whole program.
<p><dt><code>binary</code>, <code>binary-arch</code>, <code>binary-indep</code><dd>The <kbd>binary</kbd> target should be all that is necessary for the user
to build the binary package.  It is split into two parts:
<kbd>binary-arch</kbd> builds the packages' output files which are
specific to a particular architecture, and <kbd>binary-indep</kbd>
builds those which are not.<P>

<kbd>binary</kbd> should usually be a target with no commands which simply
depends on <kbd>binary-arch</kbd> and <kbd>binary-indep</kbd>.<P>

Both <kbd>binary-*</kbd> targets should depend on the <kbd>build</kbd> target,
above, so that the package is built if it has not been already.  It
should then create the relevant binary package(s), using
<kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> to make their control files and <kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd>
to build them and place them in the parent of the top level directory.<P>

If one of the <kbd>binary-*</kbd> targets has nothing to do (this will be
always be the case if the source generates only a single binary
package, whether architecture-dependent or not) it <em>must</em> still
exist, but should always succeed.<P>

<A href="ch-binarypkg.html">Binary packages, chapter 2</A> describes how to construct binary packages.<P>

The <kbd>binary</kbd> targets must be invoked as root.
<p><dt><code>clean</code><dd>This should undo any effects that the <kbd>build</kbd> and <kbd>binary</kbd>
targets may have had, except that it should leave alone any output
files created in the parent directory by a run of <kbd>binary</kbd>.<P>

If a <kbd>build</kbd> file is touched at the end of the <kbd>build</kbd> target,
as suggested above, it must be removed as the first thing that
<kbd>clean</kbd> does, so that running <kbd>build</kbd> again after an interrupted
<kbd>clean</kbd> doesn't think that everything is already done.<P>

The <kbd>clean</kbd> target must be invoked as root if <kbd>binary</kbd> has
been invoked since the last <kbd>clean</kbd>, or if <kbd>build</kbd> has been
invoked as root (since <kbd>build</kbd> may create directories, for
example).
<p><dt><code>get-orig-source</code> (optional)<dd>This target fetches the most recent version of the original source
package from a canonical archive site (via FTP or WWW, for example),
does any necessary rearrangement to turn it into the original source
tarfile format described below, and leaves it in the current directory.<P>

This target may be invoked in any directory, and should take care to
clean up any temporary files it may have left.<P>

This target is optional, but providing it if possible is a good idea.
<p></dl>


The <kbd>build</kbd>, <kbd>binary</kbd> and <kbd>clean</kbd> targets must be
invoked with a current directory of the package's top-level
directory.
<P>

Additional targets may exist in <code>debian/rules</code>, either as
published or undocumented interfaces or for the package's internal
use.

<h3><A name="s3.2.2">
3.2.2 <code>debian/control</code>
</A></h3>

This file contains version-independent details about the source
package and about the binary packages it creates.<P>

It is a series of sets of control fields, each syntactically similar
to a binary package control file.  The sets are separated by one or
more blank lines.  The first set is information about the source
package in general; each subsequent set describes one binary package
that the source tree builds.<P>

The syntax and semantics of the fields are described below in
<A href="ch-controlfields.html">Control files and their fields, chapter 4</A>.<P>

The general (binary-package-independent) fields are:
<ul compact>
<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Source"><code>Source</code></A> (mandatory)<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Maintainer"><code>Maintainer</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-classification"><code>Section</code> and <code>Priority</code></A>
(classification, mandatory)<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Standards-Version"><code>Standards-Version</code></A></ul>
<P>

The per-binary-package fields are:
<ul compact>
<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Package"><code>Package</code></A> (mandatory)<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Architecture"><code>Architecture</code></A> (mandatory)<li><A href="ch-descriptions.html"><code>Description</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-classification"><code>Section</code> and <code>Priority</code></A> (classification)<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Essential"><code>Essential</code></A><li><A href="ch-relationships.html"><code>Depends</code> et al.</A> (package interrelationships)</ul>
<P>

These fields are used by <kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> to generate control
files for binary packages (see below), by <kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd> to
generate the <code>.changes</code> file to accompany the upload, and by
<kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> when it creates the <code>.dsc</code> source control file as
part of a source archive.<P>

The fields here may contain variable references - their values will be
substituted by <kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd>, <kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd> or
<kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> when they generate output control files.  See <A href="#s-srcsubstvars"><code>debian/substvars</code> and variable substitutions, subsection 3.2.4</A> for details.<P>
<hr>
<h4><A name="s3.2.2.1">
3.2.2.1 User-defined fields
</A></h4>

Additional user-defined fields may be added to the source package
control file.  Such fields will be ignored, and not copied to (for
example) binary or source package control files or upload control
files.<P>

If you wish to add additional unsupported fields to these output files
you should use the mechanism described here.<P>

Fields in the main source control information file with names starting
<code>X</code>, followed by one or more of the letters <code>BCS</code> and a hyphen
<code>-</code>, will be copied to the output files.  Only the part of the
field name after the hyphen will be used in the output file.  Where
the letter <code>B</code> is used the field will appear in binary package
control files, where the letter <code>S</code> is used in source package
control files and where <code>C</code> is used in upload control
(<code>.changes</code>) files.<P>

For example, if the main source information control file contains the
field
<pre>XBS-Comment: I stand between the candle and the star.</pre>
then the binary and source package control files will contain the
field
<pre>Comment: I stand between the candle and the star.</pre>
<hr>
<h3><A name="s-dpkgchangelog">
3.2.3 <code>debian/changelog</code>
</A></h3>

This file records the changes to the Debian-specific parts of the
package<A href="footnotes.html#6" name="fr6">[6]</A>.<P>

It has a special format which allows the package building tools to
discover which version of the package is being built and find out
other release-specific information.<P>

That format is a series of entries like this:<P>
<pre><var>package</var> (<var>version</var>) <var>distribution(s)</var>; urgency=<var>urgency</var>

  * <var>change details</var>
    <var>more change details</var>
  * <var>even more change details</var>

 -- <var>maintainer name and email address</var>  <var>date</var></pre><P>

<var>package</var> and <var>version</var> are the source package name and
version number. <P>
 
<var>distribution(s)</var> lists the distributions where
this version should be installed when it is uploaded - it is copied to
the <code>Distribution</code> field in the <code>.changes</code> file.  See <A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Distribution"><code>Distribution</code>, subsection 4.2.14</A>.<P>

<var>urgency</var> is the value for the <code>Urgency</code> field in the
<code>.changes</code> file for the upload.  See <A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Urgency"><code>Urgency</code>, subsection 4.2.15</A>.  It is
not possible to specify an urgency containing commas; commas are used
to separate <code></code><var>keyword</var><code>=</code><var>value</var><code></code> settings in the <kbd>dpkg</kbd>
changelog format (though there is currently only one useful
<var>keyword</var>, <code>urgency</code>).<P>

The change details may in fact be any series of lines starting with at
least two spaces, but conventionally each change starts with an
asterisk and a separating space and continuation lines are indented so
as to bring them in line with the start of the text above.  Blank
lines may be used here to separate groups of changes, if desired.<P>

The maintainer name and email address should <em>not</em> necessarily be
those of the usual package maintainer.  They should be the details of
the person doing <em>this</em> version.  The information here will be
copied to the <code>.changes</code> file, and then later used to send an
acknowledgement when the upload has been installed.<P>

The <var>date</var> should be in RFC822 format<A href="footnotes.html#7" name="fr7">[7]</A>; it should include the
timezone specified numerically, with the timezone name or abbreviation
optionally present as a comment.<P>

The first `title' line with the package name should start at the left
hand margin; the `trailer' line with the maintainer and date details
should be preceded by exactly one space.  The maintainer details and
the date must be separated by exactly two spaces.<P>

An Emacs mode for editing this format is available: it is called
<code>debian-changelog-mode</code>.  You can have this mode selected
automatically when you edit a Debian changelog by adding a local
variables clause to the end of the changelog.
<hr>
<h4><A name="s3.2.3.1">
3.2.3.1 Defining alternative changelog formats
</A></h4>

It is possible to use a different format to the standard one, by
providing a parser for the format you wish to use.<P>

In order to have <code>dpkg-parsechangelog</code> run your parser, you must
include a line within the last 40 lines of your file matching the Perl
regular expression:
<code>\schangelog-format:\s+([0-9a-z]+)\W</code>
The part in parentheses should be the name of the format.  For
example, you might say:
<pre>@@@ changelog-format: joebloggs @@@</pre>
Changelog format names are non-empty strings of alphanumerics.<P>

If such a line exists then <code>dpkg-parsechangelog</code> will look for the
parser as <code>/usr/lib/dpkg/parsechangelog/</code><var>format-name</var><code></code> or
<code>/usr/local/lib/dpkg/parsechangelog/</code><var>format-name</var><code></code>; it is an
error for it not to find it, or for it not to be an executable
program.  The default changelog format is <code>dpkg</code>, and a parser for
it is provided with the <code>dpkg</code> package.<P>

The parser will be invoked with the changelog open on standard input
at the start of the file.  It should read the file (it may seek if it
wishes) to determine the information required and return the parsed
information to standard output in the form of a series of control
fields in the standard format.  By default it should return
information about only the most recent version in the changelog; it
should accept a <code>-v</code><var>version</var><code></code> option to return changes
information from all versions present <em>strictly after</em>
<var>version</var>, and it should then be an error for <var>version</var> not to
be present in the changelog.<P>

The fields are:
<ul compact>
<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Source"><code>Source</code></A><li><A href="ch-versions.html"><code>Version</code></A> (mandatory)<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Distribution"><code>Distribution</code></A> (mandatory)<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Urgency"><code>Urgency</code></A> (mandatory)<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Maintainer"><code>Maintainer</code></A> (mandatory)<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Date"><code>Date</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Changes"><code>Changes</code></A> (mandatory)</ul>
<P>

If several versions are being returned (due to the use of <code>-v</code>),
the urgency value should be of the highest urgency code listed at the
start of any of the versions requested followed by the concatenated
(space-separated) comments from all the versions requested; the
maintainer, version, distribution and date should always be from the
most recent version.<P>

For the format of the <code>Changes</code> field see <A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Changes"><code>Changes</code>, subsection 4.2.18</A>.<P>

If the changelog format which is being parsed always or almost always
leaves a blank line between individual change notes these blank lines
should be stripped out, so as to make the resulting output compact.<P>

If the changelog format does not contain date or package name
information this information should be omitted from the output.  The
parser should not attempt to synthesise it or find it from other
sources.<P>

If the changelog does not have the expected format the parser should
exit with a nonzero exit status, rather than trying to muddle through
and possibly generating incorrect output.<P>

A changelog parser may not interact with the user at all.

<h3><A name="s-srcsubstvars">
3.2.4 <code>debian/substvars</code> and variable substitutions
</A></h3>

When <kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd>, <kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd> and
<kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> generate control files they do variable
substitutions on their output just before writing it.  Variable
substitutions have the form <code>${</code><var>variable-name</var><code>}</code>.  The optional
file <code>debian/substvars</code> contains variable substitutions to be
used; variables can also be set directly from <code>debian/rules</code>
using the <code>-V</code> option to the source packaging commands, and certain
predefined variables are available.<P>

The is usually generated and modified dynamically by
<code>debian/rules</code> targets; in this case it must be removed by the
<kbd>clean</kbd> target.<P>



See <code>dpkg-source(1)</code> for full details about source
variable substitutions, including the format of
<code>debian/substvars</code>.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.2.5">
3.2.5 <code>debian/files</code>
</A></h3>

This file is not a permanent part of the source tree; it is used while
building packages to record which files are being generated.
<kbd>dpkg-genchanges</kbd> uses it when it generates a <code>.changes</code> file.<P>

It should not exist in a shipped source package, and so it (and any
backup files or temporary files such as
<code>files.new</code><A href="footnotes.html#8" name="fr8">[8]</A>) should be removed by the
<kbd>clean</kbd> target.  It may also be wise to ensure a fresh start by
emptying or removing it at the start of the <kbd>binary</kbd> target.<P>

<kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> adds an entry to this file for the <code>.deb</code>
file that will be created by <kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd> from the control file
that it generates, so for most packages all that needs to be done with
this file is to delete it in <kbd>clean</kbd>.<P>

If a package upload includes files besides the source package and any
binary packages whose control files were made with
<kbd>dpkg-gencontrol</kbd> then they should be placed in the parent of the
package's top-level directory and <kbd>dpkg-distaddfile</kbd> should be
called to add the file to the list in <code>debian/files</code>.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.2.6">
3.2.6 <code>debian/tmp</code>
</A></h3>

This is the canonical temporary location for the construction of
binary packages by the <kbd>binary</kbd> target.  The directory <code>tmp</code>
serves as the root of the filesystem tree as it is being constructed
(for example, by using the package's upstream makefiles install
targets and redirecting the output there), and it also contains the
<code>DEBIAN</code> subdirectory.  See <A href="ch-binarypkg.html#s-bincreating">Creating package files - <kbd>dpkg-deb</kbd>, section 2.1</A>.<P>

If several binary packages are generated from the same source tree it
is usual to use several <code>debian/tmp</code><var>something</var><code></code> directories,
for example <code>tmp-a</code> or <code>tmp-doc</code>.<P>

Whatever <code>tmp</code> directories are created and used by <kbd>binary</kbd>
must of course be removed by the <kbd>clean</kbd> target.

<h2><A name="s-sourcearchives">
3.3 Source packages as archives
</A></h2>

As it exists on the FTP site, a Debian source package consists of
three related files.  You must have the right versions of all three to
be able to use them.<P>

<dl>
<dt>Debian source control file - <code>.dsc</code><dd>This file contains a series of fields, identified and separated just
like the fields in the control file of a binary package.  The fields
are listed below; their syntax is described above, in
<A href="ch-controlfields.html">Control files and their fields, chapter 4</A>.
<ul compact>
<li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Source"><code>Source</code></A><li><A href="ch-versions.html"><code>Version</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Maintainer"><code>Maintainer</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Binary"><code>Binary</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Architecture"><code>Architecture</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Standards-Version"><code>Standards-Version</code></A><li><A href="ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Files"><code>Files</code></A></ul>
<P>

The source package control file is generated by <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd>
when it builds the source archive, from other files in the source
package, described above.  When unpacking it is checked against the
files and directories in the other parts of the source package, as
described below.
<dt>Original source archive - <code></code><var>package</var><code>_</code><var>upstream-version</var><code>.orig.tar.gz</code><dd>This is a compressed (with <code>gzip -9</code>) <kbd>tar</kbd> file containing
the source code from the upstream authors of the program.  The tarfile
unpacks into a directory
<code></code><var>package</var><code>-</code><var>upstream-version</var><code>.orig</code>, and does not contain
files anywhere other than in there or in its subdirectories.
<dt>Debianisation diff - <code></code><var>package</var><code>_</code><var>upstream_version-revision</var><code>.diff.gz</code><dd>This is a unified context diff (<code>diff -u</code>) giving the changes which
are required to turn the original source into the Debian source.
These changes may only include editing and creating plain files.  The
permissions of files, the targets of symbolic links and the
characteristics of special files or pipes may not be changed and no
files may be removed or renamed.<P>

All the directories in the diff must exist, except the <code>debian</code>
subdirectory of the top of the source tree, which will be created by
<kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> if necessary when unpacking.<P>

The <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> program will automatically make the
<code>debian/rules</code> file executable (see below).
</dl>
<P>

If there is no original source code - for example, if the package is
specially prepared for Debian or the Debian maintainer is the same as
the upstream maintainer - the format is slightly different: then there
is no diff, and the tarfile is named
<code></code><var>package</var><code>_</code><var>version</var><code>.tar.gz</code> and contains a directory
<code></code><var>package</var><code>-</code><var>version</var><code></code>.
<hr>
<h2><A name="s3.4">
3.4 Unpacking a Debian source package without <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd>
</A></h2>

<code>dpkg-source -x</code> is the recommended way to unpack a Debian source
package.  However, if it is not available it is possible to unpack a
Debian source archive as follows:

<ol compact>
<li>Untar the tarfile, which will create a <code>.orig</code> directory.<li>Rename the <code>.orig</code> directory to
<code></code><var>package</var><code>-</code><var>version</var><code></code>.<li>Create the subdirectory <code>debian</code> at the top of the source
tree.<li>Apply the diff using <code>patch -p0</code>.<li>Untar the tarfile again if you want a copy of the original
source code alongside the Debianised version.</ol>
<P>

It is not possible to generate a valid Debian source archive without
using <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd>.  In particular, attempting to use
<kbd>diff</kbd> directly to generate the <code>.diff.gz</code> file will not work.
<hr>
<h3><A name="s3.4.1">
3.4.1 Restrictions on objects in source packages
</A></h3>

The source package may not contain any hard links<A href="footnotes.html#9" name="fr9">[9]</A><A href="footnotes.html#10" name="fr10">[10]</A>, device special files, sockets or setuid or setgid
files.<A href="footnotes.html#11" name="fr11">[11]</A><P>

The source packaging tools manage the changes between the original and
Debianised source using <kbd>diff</kbd> and <kbd>patch</kbd>.  Turning the
original source tree as included in the <code>.orig.tar.gz</code> into the
debianised source must not involve any changes which cannot be handled
by these tools.  Problematic changes which cause <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> to
halt with an error when building the source package are:
<ul compact>
<li>Adding or removing symbolic links, sockets or pipes.<li>Changing the targets of symbolic links.<li>Creating directories, other than <code>debian</code>.<li>Changes to the contents of binary files.</ul>

Changes which cause <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> to print a warning but continue
anyway are:
<ul compact>
<li>Removing files, directories or symlinks.  <A href="footnotes.html#12" name="fr12">[12]</A><li>Changed text files which are missing the usual final newline
(either in the original or the modified source tree).</ul>

Changes which are not represented, but which are not detected by
<kbd>dpkg-source</kbd>, are:
<ul compact>
<li>Changing the permissions of files (other than
<code>debian/rules</code>) and directories.</ul>
<P>

The <code>debian</code> directory and <code>debian/rules</code> are handled
specially by <kbd>dpkg-source</kbd> - before applying the changes it will
create the <code>debian</code> directory, and afterwards it will make
<code>debian/rules</code> world-exectuable.
