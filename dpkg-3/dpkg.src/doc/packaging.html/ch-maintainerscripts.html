Package maintainer scripts
and installation procedure
</h1>
<hr>
<h2><A name="s6.1">
6.1 Introduction to package maintainer scripts
</A></h2>

It is possible supply scripts as part of a package which <kbd>dpkg</kbd>
will run for you when your package is installed, upgraded or removed.<P>

These scripts should be the files <code>preinst</code>, <code>postinst</code>,
<code>prerm</code> and <code>postrm</code> in the control area of the package.  They
must be proper exectuable files; if they are scripts (which is
recommended) they must start with the usual <code>#!</code> convention.  They
should be readable and executable to anyone, and not world-writeable.<P>

<kbd>dpkg</kbd> looks at the exit status from these scripts.  It is
important that they exit with a non-zero status if there is an error,
so that <kbd>dpkg</kbd> can stop its processing.  For shell scripts this
means that you <em>almost always</em> need to use <code>set -e</code> (this is
usually true when writing shell scripts, in fact).  It is also
important, of course, that they don't exit with a non-zero status if
everything went well.<P>

It is necessary for the error recovery procedures that the scripts be
idempotent: ie, invoking the same script several times in the same
situation should do no harm.  If the first call failed, or aborted
half way through for some reason, the second call should merely do the
things that were left undone the first time, if any, and exit with a
success status.<P>

When a package is upgraded a combination of the scripts from the old
and new packages is called in amongst the other steps of the upgrade
procedure.  If your scripts are going to be at all complicated you
need to be aware of this, and may need to check the arguments to your
scripts.<P>

Broadly speaking the <kbd>preinst</kbd> is called before (a particular
version of) a package is installed, and the <kbd>postinst</kbd> afterwards;
the <kbd>prerm</kbd> before (a version of) a package is removed and the
<kbd>postrm</kbd> afterwards.<P>
 

Programs called from maintainer scripts should not normally have a
path prepended to them. Before installation is started <kbd>dpkg</kbd>
checks to see if the programs <kbd>ldconfig</kbd>,
<kbd>start-stop-daemon</kbd>, <kbd>install-info</kbd>, and <kbd>update-rc.d</kbd>
can be found via the <code>PATH</code> environment variable. Those programs,
and any other program that one would expect to on the <code>PATH</code>,
should thus be invoked without an absolute pathname. Maintainer
scripts should also not reset the <code>PATH</code>, though they might choose
to modify it by pre- or appending package-specific directories. These
considerations really apply to all shell scripts.

<h2><A name="s-unpackphase">
6.3 Details of unpack phase of installation or upgrade
</A></h2>

The procedure on installation/upgrade/overwrite/disappear (ie, when
running <code>dpkg --unpack</code>, or the unpack stage of <code>dpkg
--install</code>) is as follows.  In each case if an error occurs the
actions in are general run backwards - this means that the maintainer
scripts are run with different arguments in reverse order.  These are
the `error unwind' calls listed below.

<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>If a version the package is already
installed, call
<pre><var>old-prerm</var> upgrade <var>new-version</var></pre>
<p><li>If this gives an error (ie, a non-zero exit status), dpkg will
attempt instead:
<pre><var>new-prerm</var> failed-upgrade <var>old-version</var></pre>
Error unwind, for both the above cases:
<pre><var>old-postinst</var> abort-upgrade <var>new-version</var></pre>
<p></ol>

<p><li>If a `conflicting' package is being removed at the same time:
<ol>
<li>If any packages depended on that conflicting package and
<code>--auto-deconfigure</code> is specified, call, for each such package:
<pre><var>deconfigured's-prerm</var> deconfigure \
    in-favour <var>package-being-installed</var> <var>version</var> \
    removing <var>conflicting-package</var> <var>version</var></pre>
Error unwind:
<pre><var>deconfigured's-postinst</var> abort-deconfigure \
    in-favour <var>package-being-installed-but-failed</var> <var>version</var> \
    removing <var>conflicting-package</var> <var>version</var></pre>
The deconfigured packages are marked as requiring configuration, so
that if <code>--install</code> is used they will be configured again if
possible.
<p><li>To prepare for removal of the conflicting package, call:
<pre><var>conflictor's-prerm</var> remove in-favour <var>package</var> <var>new-version</var></pre>
Error unwind:
<pre><var>conflictor's-postinst</var> abort-remove \
    in-favour <var>package</var> <var>new-version</var></pre>
<p></ol>

<p><li><ol>
<li>If the package is being upgraded, call:
<pre><var>new-preinst</var> upgrade <var>old-version</var></pre>
<p><li>Otherwise, if the package had some configuration files from a previous
version installed (ie, it is in the `configuration files only' state):
<pre><var>new-preinst</var> install <var>old-version</var></pre>
<p><li>Otherwise (ie, the package was completely purged):
<pre><var>new-preinst</var> install</pre>
Error unwind versions, respectively:
<pre><var>new-postrm</var> abort-upgrade <var>old-version</var>
<var>new-postrm</var> abort-install <var>old-version</var>
<var>new-postrm</var> abort-install</pre>
<p></ol>

<p><li>The new package's files are unpacked, overwriting any that may be on
the system already, for example any from the old version of the same
package or from another package (backups of the old files are left
around, and if anything goes wrong dpkg will attempt to put them back
as part of the error unwind).<P>

It is an error for a package to contains files which are on the system
in another package, unless <code>Replaces</code> is used (see
<A href="ch-relationships.html#s-replaces"><code>Replaces</code> - overwriting files and replacing packages, section 8.5</A>).  Currently the <code>--force-overwrite</code> flag is
enabled, downgrading it to a warning, but this may not always be the
case.<P>

It is a more serious error for a package to contain a plain file or
other kind of nondirectory where another package has a directory
(again, unless <code>Replaces</code> is used).  This error can be overridden
if desired using <code>--force-overwrite-dir</code>, but this is not advisable.<P>

Packages which overwrite each other's files produce behaviour which
though deterministic is hard for the system administrator to
understand.  It can easily lead to `missing' programs if, for example,
a package is installed which overwrites a file from another package,
and is then removed again.<A href="footnotes.html#19" name="fr19">[19]</A><P>

A directory will never be replaced by a symbolic links to a directory
or vice versa; instead, the existing state (symlink or not) will be
left alone and <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will follow the symlink if there is one.
<p><li><ol>
<li>If the package is being upgraded, call
<pre><var>old-postrm</var> upgrade <var>new-version</var></pre>
<p><li>If this fails, <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will attempt:
<pre><var>new-postrm</var> failed-upgrade <var>old-version</var></pre>
Error unwind, for both cases:
<pre><var>old-preinst</var> abort-upgrade <var>new-version</var></pre>
<p></ol>


This is the point of no return - if <kbd>dpkg</kbd> gets this far, it won't
back off past this point if an error occurs.  This will leave the
package in a fairly bad state, which will require a successful
reinstallation to clear up, but it's when <kbd>dpkg</kbd> starts doing
things that are irreversible.
<p><li>Any files which were in the old version of the package but not in the
new are removed.
<p><li>The new file list replaces the old.
<p><li>The new maintainer scripts replace the old.
<p><li>Any packages all of whose files have been overwritten during the
installation, and which aren't required for dependencies, are considered
to have been removed.  For each such package,

<ol>
<li><kbd>dpkg</kbd> calls:
<pre><var>disappearer's-postrm</var> disappear \
    <var>overwriter</var> <var>overwriter-version</var></pre>
<p><li>The package's maintainer scripts are removed.
<p><li>It is noted in the status database as being in a sane state, namely
not installed (any conffiles it may have are ignored, rather than
being removed by <kbd>dpkg</kbd>).  Note that disappearing packages do not
have their prerm called, because <kbd>dpkg</kbd> doesn't know in advance
that the package is going to vanish.
<p></ol>

<p><li>Any files in the package we're unpacking that are also listed in the
file lists of other packages are removed from those lists.  (This will
lobotomise the file list of the `conflicting' package if there is one.)
<p><li>The backup files made during installation, above, are deleted.
<p><li>The new package's status is now sane, and recorded as `unpacked'.  Here
is another point of no return - if the conflicting package's removal
fails we do not unwind the rest of the installation; the conflicting
package is left in a half-removed limbo.
<p><li>If there was a conflicting package we go and do the removal actions
(described below), starting with the removal of the conflicting
package's files (any that are also in the package being installed
have already been removed from the conflicting package's file list,
and so do not get removed now).
<p></ol>

<h2><A name="s6.4">
6.4 Details of configuration
</A></h2>

When we configure a package (this happens with <code>dpkg --install</code>, or
with <code>--configure</code>), we first update the conffiles and then call:
<pre><var>postinst</var> configure <var>most-recently-configured-version</var></pre><P>

No attempt is made to unwind after errors during configuration.<P>

If there is no most recently configured version <kbd>dpkg</kbd> will pass a
null argument; older versions of dpkg may pass
<code>&lt;unknown&gt;</code> (including the angle brackets) in this case.
Even older ones do not pass a second argument at all, under any
circumstances.
<hr>
<h2><A name="s6.5">
6.5 Details of removal and/or configuration purging
</A></h2>

<ol>
<li><pre><var>prerm</var> remove</pre>
<p><li>The package's files are removed (except conffiles).
<p><li><pre><var>postrm</var> remove</pre>
<p><li>All the maintainer scripts except the postrm are removed.<P>

If we aren't purging the package we stop here.  Note that packages
which have no postrm and no conffiles are automatically purged when
removed, as there is no difference except for the <kbd>dpkg</kbd> status.
<p><li>The conffiles and any backup files (<code>~</code>-files, <code>#*#</code> files,
<code>%</code>-files, <code>.dpkg-{old,new,tmp}</code>, etc.) are removed.
<p><li><pre><var>postrm</var> purge</pre>
<p><li>The package's file list is removed.
<p></ol>


No attempt is made to unwind after errors during removal.
